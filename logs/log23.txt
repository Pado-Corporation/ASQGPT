Editor’s Note: We reviewed this article on September 24, 2023. As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.

Period, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren't blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month. 

Lucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I'll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.

Keep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.

COSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH

BEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types

KEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid

PRICE: $19

ABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.

About My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts

My skin can be unpredictable. But, as I've gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.  

Ingredients: One key, familiar ingredient 

The tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.

The Feel: Like a bandage

You can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Packaging: Easy to store

The 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish

I placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.

Even with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn't budge overnight.

If you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn't expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn't gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don't believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Value: Worth it

Was this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

Similar Products: You've got options 

squish. Flower Power Acne Patches ($14): This pack of 20 floral hydrocolloid pimple patches to help zap blemishes overnight and let's face it, they're pretty darn cute. Pimple, but make them pretty. 

Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Variety Pack ($7): These 36 count medical-grade, chemical-free, allergy-tested patches stay put no matter how much you toss and turn throughout the night. 

Final Verdict

If you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won't regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.

HOMEGUIDEYOUR PERFECT PIMPLE PATCH
Your Perfect Pimple Patch
by ALI OSHINSKY

Ever since I stuck a cut-up Band-Aid on my face in the hopes of healing a particularly uncomfortable whitehead, I’ve been convinced that all hydrocolloid patches [i.e. pimple patches] are pretty much the same. When I emailed cosmetic chemist Victoria Fu on the subject, she confirmed my suspicion. “Hydrocolloid dressings have been around for a while,” Victoria explains, “and they’re all generally made in the same way.” Basically, there’s a special congealing liquid that’s combined with adhesive, and the mixture is applied to a plastic sheet. Sometimes, Victoria notes, acne-fighting ingredients are added to the adhesive-hydrocolloid mixture, but this doesn’t exactly do much. “You’re better off applying your regular acne treatments before applying the dressing,” says Victoria.

Thickness is another thing that doesn’t really matter—thick or thin patches shrink pimples at the same rate. In fact, the only variable you need to keep in mind is how well the patch sticks to your skin . “With good adherence,” Victoria explains, “a hydrocolloid can create an enclosed, moist, protected environment for hours and even days.”

You won't find any patches with attachment issues below. And then I further refined the list, based on price, size, and translucence. Some are more matte than others for invisible daily wear, some are big, some are tiny, some have funky shapes and colors. But enough of that, your perfect pack awaits.

The Cheapest: Peach Slices + Alba Botanica

Unlike sometimes pricey spot treatments, pimple patches don’t need to be expensive to work. Both Peach Slices and Alba Botanica’s versions net out to under $.20 per patch (15 and 18 respectively). And while Peach Slices is definitely the cheapest, Alba’s is more matte—perfect for daytime use. Plus, both are easy to buy IRL in a pinch—Peach Slices is sold at CVS, while Alba is at Target.

The Most Invisible: Rael

It doesn’t matter what a patch looks like when you’re wearing it to bed. When you want to wear it to work, it’s a different story—shiny patches stand out from skin or makeup, but matte ones go more or less undetected. These Rael patches have a slightly thinner outer edge to blend into skin, and the plastic laminate has a powdery, matte finish that’s not too conspicuous. It’s the best choice options for keeping your zit protected and treated during work hours.

The Cleanest Application: Avarelle

A big part of making sure your patch adheres well is how you apply it. Some patches, when you try to seperate them from their plastic backing, ball up on the side and create a bump that doesn’t lay flat. These Avarelle patches are packaged on a clear, perforated plastic sheet that you can fold and peel off while keeping the patch itself intact. It comes in classic, AM and PM versions (the AM versions are smaller and less obvious, and they’re infused with different anti-acne ingredients), but since the additives don’t make much of a difference, you can pick at random—I like the classic version for no reason in particular. All three variations come with the same great backing.

The One For Cysts: ZitSticka Killa Patches

Not a hydrocolloid, ZitSticka’s patches consist of a plastic cover, an adhesive ring, and a pad of salicylic acid and niacinamide microdarts meant to penetrate the epidermis and reach deep into those painful, under-the-skin pimples. Other pimple patch brands make cystic acne-fighting patches with microdarts, but ZitSticka’s are the sturdiest and feel the most comfortable on skin. The darts are the biggest, but the patch itself is slim and adheres well. They’re also the least conspicuous of the microdart patches, if you’re into wearing them out. ZitSticka’s patches are also the most expensive on this list, and come in pretty silly packaging—half of the pack is individually wrapped Killa patches, and the other half is filled with cleaning pads, which I’d recommend you skip. (Rubbing alcohol on cystic pimples only dries out the top layer of skin and traps the infection down there for longer.) Still, if you’ve tried everything you can for cysts and still can’t get relief, these are worth a try—not only do they reduce the size of the cyst, but they also prevent you from picking and making it worse.

The Best XL: Hero Mighty Patch Surface

Out of all the large acne patches I tried, the Mighty Patch Surfaces were by far the best—large enough to cover a couple close-together back zits, and sturdy enough to stay put through a shower and outfit changes. They also do a great job of being invisible, despite the large size. But that being said, if you don’t care about it blending in, Band-Aid Hydro Seal Blister Heels are of comparable size and sturdiness, and one pack costs a third as much at the drugstore.

The Cute One: Starface

The one to wear when you don’t want your coworkers staring at your face thinking, ‘Is that a pimple patch?’ They're star-shaped and yellow and quite conspicuous, but that’s the point! They're very cute. Recently, I’ve been relying on these the most for daytime—and now when a zit pops up on my cheek, I actually get excited about it. Is that weird? A bonus perk is that it’s nearly impossible to lose the little yellow pod they come in, a problem I’ve noticed with the slim sheets of other packages. Peel it off gently to avoid wrinkling any of the star points.

Reviewed: I Tried the Killa Cystic Acne Patches and OMG

I could genuinely cry right now?

BY ELIZABETH DENTONPUBLISHED: FEB 22, 2019

When I was a teenager, I was one of the lucky few who made it through high school without any acne, so I kind of thought I’d be safe forever. But now that I’m in my early 30s (33 is still considered early, right?), my jaw has become a minefield of hormonal, cystic pimples that flare up at the first sign of PMS. Yay.

You wouldn’t know it by looking at me, though, because my zits so rarely come to a head—they just live deep inside, haunting me, so painful and hot that I sit there dreaming about cutting them out (dark, but true). Which is why I was stoked to hear about ZitSticka, a new acne patch specifically designed to treat below-the-surface pimples before they take over your face. And, to see if they were really worth the hype, I tested them out in the name of science clear skin.

THE PATCH DEETS

More From Cosmopolitan
 

“But I’m already obsessed with acne patches!” you cry. And, hey, same. But these are different than the hydrocolloid bandages you’ve been using from, say, Peach & Lily or CosRx. Because unlike traditional patches, which only work on zits that have already “popped” (so they can absorb fluid from the pimple), ZitSticka’s patches treat unpopped, underground zits using itty-bitty, medication-filled micro-darts. Stay with me, here.

I Tried That Viral Boob Mask From Instagram
Guess How Often You Should Wash Your Hair?

The patch—aptly named Killa—looks like a regular hydrocolloid bandage, but with one key difference: Its sticky surface is covered with 24 dissolvable micro-darts that gently penetrate the stratum corneum and epidermis (your top two layers of skin) to push medication into your pimple. Each dart is filled with acne-fighting and skin-healing ingredients, including hyaluronic acid (to moisturize), niacinamide (to calm inflammation), salicylic acid (to loosen and break down the pimple), and oligopeptide-76 (to kill bacteria).

Each Killa Kit contains eight individually packaged patches and eight pre-treat wipes (soaked with salicylic acid, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and alcohol to sanitize skin and add an extra acne-killing punch before you slap on the patch). Just dab the pimple with a wipe, let it dry for a few seconds, then stick on the patch and live your life.

See the tiny micro-darts on the sticky side of the patch?

WTF IT FELT LIKE

If you’ve used hydrocolloid patches before, you know there’s nothing more satisfying than seeing it turn white from a pimple’s gunk. It’s one of the gross-but-amazing parts of skincare. Sadly, you’re not going to get that with Killa; the darts aren’t actually permeating the zit’s core (it’s impossible to pop cystic pimples from the surface), so they won’t really draw out any gunk overnight.

Still, I was surprised by how incredibly satisfying the patch felt when I applied it—like I was doing something productive for my pimple. After washing my face and wiping down my most painful cystic zit, I pressed on the Killa patch, holding it for 15 seconds, as recommended, to help it really adhere. The darts actually do feel prickly when you first press on the patch—kind of like a piece of velcro against your skin—but the whole thing is more uncomfortable than it is painful. The brand recommends leaving the patch on for at least two hours to allow the darts to fully dissolve, but I decided to apply it right before bed to give it a full seven hours to work.

THE RESULTS

Part of me didn’t expect this patch to work at all (I’ve seen too many gimmicks), but by the time I woke up and peeled it off, my zit was noticeably calmer. The warmth and redness that had been radiating from it the night before were diminished—it was now just a pink, barely painful bump. In fact, within 48 hours, the zit had cleared up completely, as if I had gotten a cortisone injection from my derm.

I was legitimately shocked these patches worked so well, so I went to experts to find out, well, why. Was I just a lucky case? According to dermatologist Mona Gohara, MD, associate clinical professor at Yale University (and not affiliated with ZitSticka), the niacinamide (vitamin B3) in each micro-dart was the “magic ingredient” for my cyst. “Niacinamide is a potent anti-inflammatory that’s sometimes prescribed as an oral medication because it’s so effective,” she says, noting that it becomes even more powerful when combined with hyaluronic acid, which “pushes in moisture to reduce irritation.” Basically, she’s not surprised Killa worked so well for me.

WILL IT WORK FOR YOU?

Here’s the thing about Killa: It’s not an acne cure. Though the micro-darts are effective at penetrating the first two layers of skin, Dr. Gohara says the ingredients seem less effective at treating and healing pimples, and more effective at reducing the inflammation within a pimple—which, in turn, can help your body heal it faster on its own.

So what does all this mean for you? Killa patches won’t replace your skincare routine—you’ll still need a good cleanser and zit-fighting regimen—nor should they, considering a box of eight patches and wipes retails for $29, which, if you’re using them daily, will add up fast. Still, when you’ve got the occasional underground zit and don’t have the time (or money) to run to the derm for an injection, you can use these patches to help reduce the redness and swelling of a pimple fast. And that, as far as I’m concerned, is worth all of the micro-darts and money in the world.

I have bought many many different pimple patches in the last few years, and I find that these are one of the best values for your money. They work as well as any other brand, but the adhesion is a little less adhesive than others. Not so much that it’s an issue, but they could afford to be a little bit stickier. I recommend these over the expensive ones that barely give you any patches, don't fall for those, get these instead. They help tremendously with my breakouts, which I get often.

 THE BEST ACNE PATCH THERE IS!
Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2019
Pattern Name: Acne PatchesVerified Purchase
I found these acne patches after trying quite a few different brands. There were many issues with the others I've tried: patches didn't stay on well, they didn't absorb the funky stuff from the acne, they left a mark, and / or were way too obvious. These SAKURA ACNE PATCHES are the opposite of all that- THEY ARE AMAZING! They stay in place until they are filled up with the junk they've absorbed. They stick so well that I can wash my face with it on so I don't spread acne germs to other parts of my face. The acne is noticeably improved after wearing the patch for even just a couple (2) hours; the blemish is lighter in color, not as swollen, and not as raised! Once the patch fills up, I remove it and apply another. I repeat the process until the blemish is gone. For me, it takes about 2-3 days from start to finish. I am so thankful to have found these patches. They help clear things up quickly and painlessly, which in turn helps me feel more confident about my skin. I've purchased these patches 3 times now and will continue to do so when I am in need. I highly recommend them! PS- SAKURA, please make some sort of face mask with the qualities and powers of these patches! I can only imagine the wonders it would do for the entire face!

I order these across Amazon from quite a few brands, and these hold up just fine. These absorb oil from my skin and help reduce pimples in a healthy manner as advertised. I prefer these compared to the versions with tea tree oil. I find that the ones without the oil help skin heal faster if there have been any breaks. I will continue to purchase this brand as necessary.

These are great! Mid-30s mom here who has suffered with chest and back acne once a month since my teens, and these knock it out overnight (most of the time)! I like that they’re fairly inconspicuous, especially on my chest/back so I’m not as self conscious.
After a shower, I just clean the area with a cotton swab and alcohol, dry, then apply and leave on until it easily comes off (usually about 24 hours later/after another shower). 9 times out of 10, that’s all it takes and the spot is gone. Ocassionally, I have to reapply again but it’s never taken more than 2 applications.
Highly recommend, these are now a staple in my house.

Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2021
Pattern Name: Acne PatchesVerified Purchase
I was always so skeptical about trends like these. I’ve suffered with acne for decades and damn — these things work. I’m horrible at skin care and I’ll touch pop squeeze everything I’m not supposed to. I should know by now that those methods will just prolong everything but I just can’t help It and want it gone now! Let me tell you these things work. As soon as I feel some type of bump, I’ll put one on and the magic works and it’ll pull everything out and I swear by day two it looks so much better compared to day two without it. The best part is as often as I use these things and for the amount of bumps I get, I still have so many patches left. You definitely get your money’s worth AND then some. I definitely recommend and I’m definitely purchasing more — especially if they’re on the [lightning]deal of the day.

Sometimes the patch is thicker than my *** but sometimes it’s as thin as my ***. The thick one that I got for the past 2 orders wouldn’t stick to my skin and by the time I woke up in the morning, the patch will be on my hair, my bed sheet, my back and nowhere to be found. It’s good for sure but it’s like playing a Russian roulette where the thick patch is the bullet.

Personally I get really deep painful pimples that last forever these take them away just leashing the little red mark like the patches do. So impressed with this product and the value.

The best blemish patches out there
Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2023
I have tried all types of blemish patches, everything from thin and sheer to rainbow clouds and stars designs, but I will never stray from these. These COSRX blemish patches give you a good assortment of sizes, and they are virtually invisible once put on, even having a blurring effect making the blemish less noticeable.

The healing process after applying these are wonderful too because they do not dry your skin and the blemish is usually gone within a day or two. I have dry skin, so I stopped using spot treatments and switched to solely these because I was not a fan of the flakiness of my skin from the spot treatments. I also love knowing that my blemish is covered and protected, from everything, and even stops me from messing with it and making it worse. Not only that, but I also have skin that can be sensitive to some adhesives, but never had any issues or reactions with these. They adhere really well, and will not budge until you decided to remove them, unlike others, where I may go to bed with the patch on my face but wake up with it stuck to the pillow.

Not for me
Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2023
A lot of people rave about these, but I don’t think they really do anything for my acne. When I take them off, they rip the bump open and that’s it really!

This is really an excellent product it does exactly what it says --either dramatically improves or gets rid of the blemish altogether anywhere from as quickly as overnight to two to three days at most depending on the blemish you do have to apply it on clean dry skin so it sticks well I wouldn't wear it out during the day because while it is pretty sheer you can still see it because it doesn't lay flush on your skin but it does exactly what it says and it's fantastic and I can't say enough about it

Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2023

I get picky with pimples and these are a godsend—basically the only way I’ll stop is a physical barrier. These don’t suck pimple gunk out, but they definitely encourage them to come to a head if they have one. I was resistant to paying for tiny hydrocolloid patches, but these are just worth it for me. I’ve tried other pimple patches (US brands) and they frankly don’t compare.

Works the way it supposed to, but the first pack I opened already had a little white dots on the pimple patches. It may have been stored somewhere with moisture, but they still looked new, so I will still be using them. I love that they have a variety of sizes in this pack came with a lot. I typically use a different brand, but they were not available online. Good overall.

I have had two blemishes on my forehead that never came to a "head" but wouldn't go away either.
After just a week of using this product, they are almost gone! A generous amount came with the order; but I will make sure I NEVER run out!

Half half
Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023
Sometimes the patch is thicker than my *** but sometimes it’s as thin as my ***. The thick one that I got for the past 2 orders wouldn’t stick to my skin and by the time I woke up in the morning, the patch will be on my hair, my bed sheet, my back and nowhere to be found. It’s good for sure but it’s like playing a Russian roulette where the thick patch is the bullet.

Such a great value for so much less. I was obsessed with obsessed with the mighty patches put they get really expensive for not a lot especially when you have a lot of pimples. Personally I get really deep painful pimples that last forever these take them away just leashing the little red mark like the patches do. So impressed with this product and the value. Love it so much and could not recommend this more.

We put The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch to the test after receiving a complimentary sample from the brand. Keep reading for our full product review. 

Editor’s Note: We reviewed this article on September 24, 2023. As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.

Period, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren't blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month. 

Lucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I'll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.

Keep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.

COSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH

BEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types

KEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid

PRICE: $19

ABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.

About My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts

My skin can be unpredictable. But, as I've gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.  

Ingredients: One key, familiar ingredient 

The tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.

The Feel: Like a bandage

You can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Packaging: Easy to store

The 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish

I placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.

Even with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn't budge overnight.

If you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn't expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn't gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don't believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Value: Worth it

Was this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

Similar Products: You've got options 

squish. Flower Power Acne Patches ($14): This pack of 20 floral hydrocolloid pimple patches to help zap blemishes overnight and let's face it, they're pretty darn cute. Pimple, but make them pretty. 

Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Variety Pack ($7): These 36 count medical-grade, chemical-free, allergy-tested patches stay put no matter how much you toss and turn throughout the night. 

Final Verdict

If you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won't regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.

Rohto Mentholatum - Acnes Medicated Anti-Bacteria Spot Dressing. They are the best by a mile, out of all I have tried.

For hydrocolloid patches, the ones by Olive Young are the best. They do their sucking up pus job well and are the cheapest per patch (in where I'm from). I can even put on wash-off or sheet masks after I put the patches on, and the patches won't fall off after the masks! The honey ones are harder to find but slightly better than the normal ones, since the honey ones don't dry up the area if you replace the patch multiple times on the same pimple.

VT Cica Spot Patch is slightly pricier than the Olive Young patches but they have more large patches (12mm) than Olive Young. VT patches performs exactly the same as Olive Young for me so I always grab them on Yesstyle if they are on sale.

Dr. Wonder patches are less adhesive than Olive Young and VT but they are still nice, you just have to be careful if you want to wash your face while keeping the same patch on. They have larger sizes (12mm and 14mm) for the pink version but I didn't try that. What I love and buy the most from their range is the white version, which contains nicotinamide that does help lightening the acne scars! When the pus from the pimples are almost gone from using Olive Young/VT patches, I put on the Dr. Wonder White patches to have less hyperpigmentation!

For micro-needle patches though I still haven't found the best yet :c

Purito has some that I really love, even more than the COSRX ones, which I’ve been using for years. They have centella derivatives as well as the standard hydrocolloid, they’re pretty affordable on yesstyle, the sizes are really nice, they stick really well, and they also camouflage into your skin really well.

I really like the oliveyoung ones, although to be fair I don’t think I’ve tried that many brands. I like it because I can barely see it and it sticks really well

I liked the peach slices ones from CVS but honestly now I just buy them at the drugstore and cut them up into squares. Much easier to get the right size and more for your money!

They're just hydrocolloid bandages, you can get some from a drugstore and cut it up into patches

I once got a lot of acne around the end of my school year on my cheeks and my temples despite regularly washing my face everday (facewash and moisturizer), and it was the largest breakout I've ever had. It stayed for about three months until I saw this tiktok saying Vaseline actually works really well. Then I did a quick search on google and google said it worked (which isnt really a very reliable ig, but I didnt really care), so I ended up trying it. It worked after two weeks of putting Vaseline on my face after using my facewash every night, and worked so fast that the results were obvious. I dont think any other factors were the cause of my rapidly reduced acne because my routine still stayed the same. So, you can try that i guess. Also make sure to keep yourself hydrated and moisturized.

my mum buys some facewash and pimple cream from some beautician she knows and I use it
my pimples do not improve significantly though, it mostly depends on my hormone level and whether it's nearing that time of the month
another reason I have acne is because I lie on one side of the bed

I wash my face 2 times a day because my face gets fairly oily
and when those under skin acne pop up I slather a thick layer of pimple cream
occasionally when I'm free I squeeze them with tissues though I know it makes them scar

I'm experimenting with some facewashes rn to see what helps

also... I heard somewhere that passing motion helps

I bought cleansers acne patches to help out since I've been breaking out badly. I sweat a lot and the masks certainly don't help, especially since I'm half dead and a sweaty mess by the time I reach my class.

Although I still have acne it's not as bad as before. What helped me out was washing my face day and night and applying moisturizer. Moisturizer really helps out.

Definitely try Curology or buy the Ordinary products. I've tried both and they both work well. I currently use a the Ordinary face mask and common drug store moisturizer and cleansers, and there's been a noticeable difference. I also saw someone mention vaseline, but I suggest you be careful with that since it can clog your pores.

Isn't popping them making it worse?


I'm sure there's some medicine or therapy for it...if it's too big see doctor they'd clean it out properly.

Usual causes of acne are stress, bad hygiene and/or diet. Try to change your beddings regularly too. If changing these things for the better still don't help, then you could only blame your parents for your genetics. Also don't expect immediate results, be patient and be consistent.

I didn't have those, just pimples that don't leave scars. I always popped them despite being said it's better to leave them, just make sure it's clean afterwards with alchocol.
I stopped eating unhealthy food that causes pimples as much as I can, things like milk chocolate(I prefer dark one anyway), ketchup and other similary industrially over processed foods.
Also found Neutrogena clear and defend rapid gel. Instead of waiting for days until the white head appears, you can pop a pimple in a single day, then just wipe with alchocol which also dries and reduces it.

Mine flare up with caffeine intake, so I try to refrain from as many carbonated drinks and coffee, as much as possible. Dunno if it works for you.
Also, try not to let sweat dry on your face, and wash frequently, since acne mostly is due to sweat clogging up the pores leading to sebum accumulation

For me, i esp destroy them, y'know the thing and it left me with small scars everywhere around my chin..usually it appears there.
I don't usually have this acne but i guess wearing mask all the time makes it this way....
I usually consult with a dermatologist. But for emergency, i use bandaids/acne patches to cover the most offending spot. It's quite effective for me, since the patch keep my hands away, conceal the redness, while also suck the liquid inside those acnes out without the need to pop them and thus, reduce the swelling. But, i need to change it several times a day. After 3-4 days of acne patches, the swelling part usually gonna get pretty tame.
But again, what work for me might not work for you.
(Juust a disclaimer, I'm no doctor and this is not a medical advice )

don't have any, if I do get it I guess I just ignore it. Don't think too much about it, but if it's severe go to the derma. My skin used to be crystal clear that I used to get regularly get compliments for it, but a year ago, it started acting up. It's okay now, but I don't think it's as clear as it used to be. Oh well

This is what I do... really helps control
1. Drinking a lot of water
2. Drinking healthy tea (like chrysanthemum tea, 涼茶) / avoid unhealthy foods (actually tbh I don't really do this right now cause I'm a little piggy. But it helps if you have will power to change eating habits.)
3. Change pillowcase everyday + wash blanket cover / sheets once a week
4. Consistent skin care routine. Right now I am using oil cleanser + regular foam cleanser, I'm From Mugwort set, and cosrx AHA and BHA serums.

This sport involes sweating...lots of it. And what evil thing can spring up because of it? Acne.

Post up your remedies, stories, or anything involving those red buggers that show up on first dates.


I'll start. I've suffered from acne for years now, but it was stationed only in a small patch on my chest and back. No biggie, right? Well the beginning of this school year has brought on some spreadage...I don't know what caused it. Possibly increased testosterone levels? 


Regardless, the patch on my chest spread to the one on my back, and in recent weeks, it's crawled up the neck. What's a guy to do? I started taking Sulphur derivatives because I heard that worked. I tried natural remedies like honey and vinegar, but had no luck with that. Even products that you see on TV or on the shelves, but they didn't work either. I researched it a bit and discovered retinol, a derivative of vitamin A, and I had been taking vitamin A pills for a couple weeks now. I stopped for a week because of march break: vitamin a + drinking = not good, since they both go straight to the liver, so that's my reason for stopping.


After march break I started up again, but this time I broke out like mad. That was the last draw, so accutane starts today.

i disagree... sweating cleans out your pores... just make sure you shower before it re-absorbs... saunas are real good for this too...

	People who experience hyperhidrosis may also notice that increased sweating affects their acne. Up to 20% of sufferers notice that their acne flares up after excessive sweating. The most probable cause of acne in these patients is a result of water swelling an already existing obstruction in the hair duct which in turn causes a complete blockage and inflammation.

Some people are just simply more prone to it than others. I'm not sure if this is 100% true, but if you eat alot of fatty foods, sugar and such, you'll have an increased risk of an outbreak.

Might sound lame, I've noticed about sweating making it worse too, so I stopped wearing caps which reduces sweat around my head, furthermore if you just take a lemon, squeeze it out and put the juice of it over your acne spots it'll become smoother (very fast too).

I ended up with a small scar beside my chin from my helmet strape. It is biking in the summer and hockey in the winter. I also work and have to wear a mask so I get a small ring around my nose/chin/mouth. Just got to keep it clean.

What's life without chocolate 

Besides, if you do happen to get the odd spot, putting a bit of toothpaste on it overnight drys it right up, or you can dab a bit of vinegar on it in the daytime - works everytime 

Just remember to wash it off your face in the morning

Saying that I do always drink at least 2ltrs of water a day... Apparently it helps wash toxins out of your body and skin, as I'm sure you've found

I tried alot of stuff... oxy, clean and clear, benzagel, even proactiv, and nothing really did it for me. then i decided to take an appointment with a dematologist and he prescribed me a soap, a pill and a cream and so far its working absolutly amazing.

oil is what blocks pores creating an infection aka pimple. it's important to wash your face often but i think super strong stuff that dries out your face is not a very good idea. For me what worked the best before this precription stuff was straight up rinsing my face twice a day with water. I have a feeling that your skin gets used to certain products after a while and it becomes useless.

Live by Acne Patches? Dermatologists Share the Best 15 Brands of 2023

With faves from Hero Cosmetics, Peace Out, Clearasil, and more.

BYRDIE / JACLYN MASTROPASQUA

There's no shortage of over-the-counter products for clearing breakouts. But when you only have one or two zits at any given time, there's no need to treat your entire face. Enter the pimple patch, a targeted way to zap acne without exposing the rest of your skin to undue drying or irritation. According to board-certified dermatologist Sheilagh Maguiness, MD, acne patches typically contain hydrocolloid gel,1 which is often used in wound care. Hydrocolloid patches are able to keep the spot moist in order to accelerate healing and protect. In addition to healing blemishes, Dr. Maguiness notes, "The hydrocolloid in the acne sticker can help absorb sebum and dirt." 

Claire Wolinsky, MD, a New York dermatologist specializing in facial rejuvenation, says she loves pimple patches and recommends them frequently: "One reason they are particularly helpful in treating acne is because once covered, patients can't pick or squeeze their pimple, which reduces the risk of infection and bacteria." And with less trauma to the skin, Dr. Wolinsky says you're less likely to experience scarring or discoloration.

We conducted hours of research on the best acne patches, evaluating each on active ingredients to target acne as well as ingredients to soothe skin and prevent redness. We also looked at things like how easy they are to apply and how well they stay on. After considering dozens of brands and consulting with two celebrity dermatologists, we landed on the following best in show.

What We Like

Reduces redness

Soothes inflammation

Contains skin-clearing ingredients

What We Don't Like

Only one size

Celebrity aesthetician Joshua Ross of SkinLab stands behind Peace Out Acne Healing Dots. "They employ hydrocolloid2 technology that helps extract impurities and guards against external elements," he explains. What's more, the patches create a barrier between pimples and your bacteria-laden fingers while delivering a time-released infusion of ingredients.

Cosmetic nurse Kristina Kitsos is also a fan of Peace Out. "They contain salicylic acid,3 which penetrates pores to target acne blemishes and blackheads," she tells Byrdie. Additionally, Kitsos appreciates that these acne patches contain soothing aloe vera to minimize redness and skin-clearing standby vitamin A (aka retinol).4 She says that since they're formulated with hydrating ingredients, the skin is able to heal quicker and better than if a drying, alcohol formula was used.

Who It's For

If you have skin that dries out or breaks easily, this is a great pick because of the inclusion of aloe vera—which can soothe and hydrate. Even pimple patches can sometimes tear the sensitive skin around a blemish, but you won't have to worry about that with these.

Price at time of publish: $19

Active Ingredients: Hydrocolloid, salicylic acid, aloe, retinol | Amount: 10 to 40 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes

Best BudgetSoko Glam The Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch

Soko Glam

What We Like

Budget-friendly

Long-lasting adhesive

Includes two sizes

What We Don't Like

Thinner patch than other options

While most pimple patches aren't very pricey, The Klog's Soft Shield is one of the budget-friendliest of the bunch. Containing vegan hydrocolloid,2 the protective yet breathable barrier draws out impurities and helps your zits heal as quickly as possible. We love that these super-thin patches are almost invisible—perfect for wear during the day. They're unnoticeable whether you're in a virtual meeting or on a walk, and they'll keep your skin shielded from bacteria (and your fingers).

Who It's For

These pimple patches can be super helpful for those who find it hard to stop themselves from picking since they are so lightweight they can be worn anytime. They're also great for people on a budget or for those looking for a vegan formula patch.

Price at time of publish: $6

Active Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 42 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes

What We Don't Like

Only one size

A few drugstore brands have hopped on the pimple-patch bandwagon, but the best iteration comes from acne-fighting all-star Clearasil. Stick on the Spot Patches before bed, get your beauty sleep, and wake up to noticeable improvements in the size and redness of your blemishes. These patches have thinner, smooth edges, so they're able to adhere to the skin better without budging.

Who It's For

If you're a wild sleeper and often wake up to your pimple patch on your pillow, we recommend these.

What We Like

Contains skin-clearing and moisturizing ingredients

Includes two sizes

Comes with tin container

What We Don't Like

Doesn't contain hydrocolloid

Peter Thomas Roth's take on the acne patch is the super-moisturizing Invisible Dots. In addition to acne-clearing mainstays salicylic acid5 and tea tree oil,6 they call on hyaluronic acid7 to deliver much-needed moisture to the bumps that lie beneath. These aren't hydrocolloid patches, so they won't absorb the gunk out of a pimple that's already come to a head.

Who It's For

We recommend these patches for big, red pimples that you want to reduce in size quickly. They can work overnight to greatly shrink blemishes.

What We Don't Like

More effective on pimples that have come to a head

Dr. Wolinsky is a fan of COSRX Master Patches, and we're here for it. Serving up a heaping dose of hydrocolloid8 underneath each hygienic sticker, you can target even the most stubborn bumps with little effort. We also like that these Korean patches come in three different sizes.

When we tested them for ourselves, we loved that they didn't budge while we slept (even when applied over our nighttime serums). The pimple was noticeably smaller in the morning, and the patches kept the blemish from becoming irritated during use.

Who It's For

These patches come in three different sizes to best fit whatever type of pimple you have. This is a great choice if you deal with frequent acne of all kinds and need a patch that can fit both smaller and larger blemishes.

Small amount of patches

There's not much you can do about a deep pimple brewing underneath your skin—outside of placing a ZitSticka on it. The self-dissolving microdarts get to the root of the problem and prevent bumps from getting any bigger. With continued use, the blemish will become smaller without leaving a scar behind.

Who It's For

We recommend these patches for those with cystic acne that refuses to come to a head, as the mini microneedles can target the deep pimples that sit under the skin.

When it comes to pimple patches, Dr. Maguiness and Dr. Wolinsky agree on the Mighty Patch. A home run for all skin types, this pack of acne patches includes a flat, invisible option for daytime and a more conspicuous overnight sticker, each containing hydrocolloid8 to expedite healing and prevent acne scarring. They work quickly (in about 6 hours) to noticeably flatten the spot so that a scar doesn't have time to appear.

Who It's For

If you have blemishes that easily scar even when you don't pick or prod at them, we love these patches that can help stop scars from forming.

You definitely want BHA (Beta Hydroxy Acid) hero salicylic acid3 on your side in the battle against acne. As you probably know, salicylic acid is exfoliating agent that can remove dead skin and reduce the appearance of whiteheads and blackheads. But the Dime Power Patch doesn't stop there. It also contains hydrocolloid,8 retinol,4 and naturally antibacterial clove essential oil11 to take on blemishes at full force.

Who It's For

If you have a big pimple that you need gone fast, the salicylic acid in the formula will give that extra boost to shrink the blemish quickly. We definitely recommend keeping these on hand if you have a special event coming up and can feel a breakout brewing.

Comes with a small amount of patches

When you're dealing with hormonal acne, standard pimple patches often aren't able to reach the nodules under the skin, which can be painful and difficult to get rid of. These patches are the ones that you'll want to try to get those hard-to-reach blemishes. It has a two-step process: swipe the pad (which is infused with tea tree oil and salicylic acid) on clean skin and then apply the patch directly to the blemish. It's made with super-fine microneedles so that the ingredients are able to penetrate the skin better, and the patch is also formulated with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and peptides to hydrate and heal the affected area and effectively flatten the pimple.


Who It's For

If you've tried everything for hormonal acne and are looking for a targeted, effective treatment without taking a trip to the dermatologist, these are a great pick. Because of the powerful formula, you should be able to see results overnight.

Pimple patches are usually clear, but you can still often see the thick material—especially on darker skin tones or under makeup.

They have super thin edges that stick onto the skin seamlessly and lay as flat as possible for a hydrocolloid patch. Even though they're less noticeable than others on the market, they're still just as effective at protecting from bacteria and removing impurities from the spot overnight.


Who It's For

Picking at your skin is a hard habit to break, but it's necessary in order to not make blemishes worse and create a scar. Wearing a pimple patch throughout the day can help, and these patches from Rael will go unnoticed while you're out with friends or even at work.

Where We Stand

The best pimple patches overall are Peace Out Acne Healing Dots. They contain hydrocolloid, and also a blend of soothing and clearing ingredients like retinol, salicylic acid, and aloe. For a more affordable option, consider The Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch, a breathable yet protective solution that draws out impurities and speeds up healing.

What to Look for When Buying Acne Patches
Hydrocolloid: "The most important thing is that the stickers or patches are made of hydrocolloid," Dr. Wolinsky tells Byrdie, which is "something dermatologists have used for wound care for a long time." The healing ingredient seals the skin underneath the patch while absorbing fluid, flattening bumps, and minimizing inflammation.8Some options, like Peach Slices Acne Spot Dots, are made with nothing more than hydrocolloid, which does an excellent job taking care of pimples on its own.
Active Ingredients: Most acne patches utilize hydrocolloid, which can be very effective on its own. However, you'll also find options containing a range of other acne-fighting ingredients. As Dr. Wolinsky notes, "Some of these patches have salicylic acid, which may help further treat a nasty breakout." Additionally, you might see soothing aloe vera extract,14 resurfacing retinol,4 complexion-clearing tea tree oil,15 or hydrating hyaluronic acid12 on the ingredients list.
Dime Beauty Power Patches are an excellent choice if you're looking for something containing salicylic acid, and Peter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots are a great option with tea tree oil. Some patches, like Mario Badescu Drying Patches, contain both.
Size: Since pimples and breakouts come in all shapes and sizes, it's nice to have a couple of different acne patches to work with. While many brands offer only one size, some packs include two or even three sizes to cover large and small zits accordingly. For instance, The Klog's Soft Shield Pimple Patches come with two sizes. You'll also find extra-large patches, which are meant to cover multi-bump breakouts.
FAQ
How do acne patches work?

"Most acne patches work by providing a moist occluded environment so that the acne lesion can heal underneath," says Dr. Maguiness. They typically contain hydrocolloid,8 which, as Dr. Wolinsky explains, absorbs the inflammatory fluid, flattens the bump, and speeds up healing. "The added bonus is that they keep fingers off and prevent picking," notes Dr. Maguiness.


How do you apply acne patches?

Starting with freshly washed hands and clean, dry skin, carefully peel the patch off the sheet. Then, gently stick it on the pimple in question, aligning the center of the patch with the center of the pimple. Leave it on for 12 to 24 hours or until it turns opaque.


How often should you use acne patches?

Generally speaking, you can use acne patches as often as needed. Since they target only a very small portion of your skin, you shouldn't have to worry about irritating the rest of your face or neck. In some cases, you might need to use two or three consecutive patches to get rid of a particularly stubborn pimple.

Do Pimple Patches Actually Work?
A dermatologist weighs in on whether zit stickers are worthwhile
FACEBOOK

The cardinal rule of acne is “don’t pick,” but when you’re faced with a whitehead that seems to have its own zip code, sometimes, all logic flies out the window. If you’ve broken the rules (and gone against dermatologists’ advice) by taking matters into your own hands, you may be left with the gory aftermath: An open wound leaking pus, oil and even blood.

Enter pimple patches, sometimes known as zit stickers, which may be able to help soothe your skin in a pinch. Dermatologist Amy Kassouf, MD, explains what these over-the-counter spot treatments can — and can’t — do for your skin troubles.

How do pimple patches work?

Pimple patches are small stickers made with a slightly gummy wound-healing gel called hydrocolloid. Larger versions are marketed as “blister bandages,” but they’re all designed to do the same thing: Help your skin heal faster.

“Pimple patches work by absorbing any drainage from the pimple and covering the wound to prevent further trauma to the site, such as picking,” Dr. Kassouf explains. “They work best on open, draining, healing pustules, papules and cysts.”

Of course, you know you’re not supposed to pick at your skin or pop zits. But if you’ve already committed this skin care sin, a pimple patch may be a helpful healer.

How to use pimple patches

Most pimple patches need to be worn for a few hours in order to do their thing, so you may want to plan to apply yours before bed. Some versions are also designed to be inconspicuous enough to be worn during the day.

Before applying your pimple patch, make sure your skin is completely dry, as the patches won’t stick as well to wet skin. If your freshly picked pimple is leaking or oozing, be sure to cleanse the spot before application.

Simply apply the pimple patch over your zit — remember, they only work on open wounds — and leave it on for the recommended amount of time (which varies by product). When you peel it off, your blemish may be smaller and less inflamed.

Can pimple patches make acne worse?

For most people, pimple patches are, at worst, simply unhelpful — which is to say that they won’t make your acne worse, but they won’t make it better, either. If you have sensitive skin, though, you may want to steer clear of pimple patches.

“They do use a bit of adhesive to stick to your skin, so if you’re allergic or sensitive to adhesive, this may aggravate the skin surrounding the lesion,” Dr. Kassouf says.

And some brands use ingredients such as salicylic acid or tea tree oil to dry out pimples, which may also dry or irritate sensitive skin.

What pimple patches can’t do

Though pimple patches can be very effective on existing lesions, they have significant limitations.

“Pimple patches don’t work at all on closed lesions or deeper lesions or even blackheads and whiteheads, which are called comedones,” Dr. Kassouf explains. “They are spot treatments for active bumps and have no ability to prevent acne from coming,” nor can they clear clogged pores or other precursors to acne flares.”

In other words, if you’re struggling with cystic acne, large-scale breakouts or other skin concerns, pimple patches aren’t going to do the trick.

What to try instead of pimple patches

There’s no real harm in using zit stickers — but they may not work, either, leaving you pimply and frustrated. “They’re really just wound healing dressings for a very specific type of lesion,” Dr. Kassouf says. “They can be helpful, but for overall acne treatment, there is little use for them. 

Don’t fret, though. You’ve got options.

“There are a lot of great over-the-counter medications these days that do more for the money,” Dr. Kassouf says.

Adapalene: This vitamin A derivative, available in topical form, can help make skin cells less sticky so they don’t hang around and clog your pores, which can not only help prevent acne but can help heal it, too.
Salicylic acid: This beta hydroxy acid is available in cleansers and topical applications to help exfoliate and clean your skin, as well as decrease acne inflammation. 
Foaming cleansers: These face washes are great for removing dirt and pollutants that can increase inflammation and breakouts.
Emergency treatments: If you have a big event coming up and need to get rid of a major pimple in a hurry, talk to your dermatologist about quick-turnaround options, including cortisone and antibiotic injections.

If your breakouts are related to an underlying issue like a hormonal imbalance, these treatments may not be enough for you. “If hormones are the issue, your dermatologist may have much better options for you,” Dr. Kassouf says.

Bottom line? Pimple patches can be a worthwhile option for certain, minor skin troubles, but don’t expect them to be a cure-all for your skin ailments.

Pimples are common and often a teenager’s worst nightmare. Waking up to a conspicuous red spot on your face could not be more horrifying. So, what to do with these small, painful, discolored bumps with a thick, white-yellow fluid (pus) at the tip?

The Difference Between Acne and Pimples

Commonly known as spots or zits, pimples are a part of acne. The dreaded pimples surface because of hormone production changes during puberty. When hormones become active during puberty, sebaceous glands located at the base of hair follicles may become overstimulated.  Sebaceous (oil) glands are microscopic glands found in your hair follicles that secrete sebum, an oily substance that protects your skin from drying out. Pimples form when dead skin cells mix with excess oil (sebum). This mixture plugs the pore, causing swelling. Bacteria can grow in the mix and lead to infection and pus. Pimples are most likely to occur during the teenage years and, for women, around menstruation.


The clearest way to distinguish between acne and pimples is to understand that pimples are a symptom of a condition, whereas acne is the condition itself, an inflammatory disorder of the skin. Someone who has acne-prone skin will experience pimples as a part of their condition; however, not everyone who gets the occasional pimple has acne-prone skin.

Pimple Patches

What do you do about pimples? You’re told not to pop, squeeze, or pick at the blemish. Popping a pimple delays the natural healing process. It can cause infection and scarring, and it may make the pimple more inflamed and noticeable.  Fortunately, technology has a solution, and that solution is pimple patches. Pimple patches are also known as acne stickers.

A pimple patch is an adhesive sticker that you apply directly to a pimple and leave on for a stretch of time to reduce the breakout. 

To use pimple patches, first clean and moisturize your face as normal. Then apply the sticker to your pimple and wear it overnight. You can keep it on while you shower, as it is waterproof, then wash your face as you would during your usual morning routine.

There are several brands of pimple patches, as well as ingredients used to treat the pimples themselves. A pimple patch is designed for one-time use since the capacity of agents to absorb oils is limited. The actual patch is disposable due to the biodegradable materials used in its production. One film of pimple patches typically consists of up to 15 patches.

Pimple patches can help pimples go away overnight. These spot treatments act as a bandage that prevents you from touching them and absorbs the fluid from the pimples, creating a moist environment for faster and improved healing. The patch won’t stop the next pimple from appearing, but the pimple can be fixed more quickly.

How the Patches Work

Chemically, how do the patches actually work? Pimple patches are commonly made of hydrocolloid, a gel-forming material originally used for healing wounds. Hydrocolloids are a heterogenous group of long-chain polymers that can be polysaccharides or proteins. Hydrocolloid just means a polymeric material that absorbs water to form a gel. The polymers used as hydrocolloids have a number of hydroxyl (-OH) groups that markedly increase their affinity for binding water.

This is a typical hydrocolloid called carboxymethylcellulose.  The orange sections are places where hydrogen bonding can occur with water molecules. This is especially true for the OH groups and the O-Na+ groups.

The application of self-adhesive hydrocolloid dressings is most commonly associated with the treatment of chronic ulcerative conditions where an open wound develops on the skin from injury, poor circulation, or pressure sores. Hydrocolloid dressings may also offer benefits in the care of acute wounds of all types.

For the small wound on your face, the pimple patches are little dressings. Hydrocolloid dressings consist of a thick, self-adhesive layer of a gellable mass that is applied to a flexible polyurethane film. Hydrocolloid dressings are made up of two layers.

The inner lining is usually made of hydrocolloids such as carboxymeth-ylcellulose, gelatin or pectin with with many water-binding groups in the chemical structure. The water-attracting material draws out fluid from the wound. The tough, outer layer is usually polyurethane, a thin transparent material that is easy to peel off.

The outer layer keeps everything in place, as well as preventing the water from evaporating and drying out the wound. The wound heals faster, and the new skin that forms is supple rather than tight and stiff. It also protects the wound from rubbing and scratching on surfaces.

Patches that only contain hydrocolloid are known as nonmedicated patches. 

“As the hydrocolloid gel adheres to the skin, it absorbs excess oil and dirt away from pimples,” said Hadley King, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist. Nonmedicated hydrocolloid patches may be worn for two to three days, as long as you change the patch every day.

The hydrocolloid dressings are available in many shapes and some also have an additional adhesive border to prevent leakage or sliding of the dressing over the wound. Adhesives are used to attach the patch to the face.

There are three types of adhesives: Acrylic, silicone, and hydrogel. Silicone or hydrogel make the most quality adhesive. It is important to use a high-quality adhesive, so it stays in one place and does not cause irritation to the skin.

The Active Ingredients in Patches

Some pimple patches are full of added acne-fighting ingredients, while others are just hydrocolloid gel patches. 

“The patch, or set of ingredients that will work best, depends on your skin type,” said Orit Markowitz, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Opti Skin in New York City.

Pimple patches may help decrease inflammation, meaning red swollen bumps that sit near the surface of the skin, or give you no results at all. Therefore, many experts believe that these patches work only on a specific type of pimple.

Here are some of the ingredients in pimple patches and how each may affect your skin:

w Salicylic acid: A beta hydroxy acid and popular acne-fighting ingredient in skin care and shampoo, salicylic acid can help unclog pores and remove excess sebum, or oil. Patches containing salicylic acid could be a good option for a fairly inflamed pimple, but they may irritate dryer, sensitive skin.

Tea tree oil or tea tree extract: Similar to salicylic acid, “tea tree oil can be very drying,” said Dr. Markowitz, making it a great tool for drying out pimples, but potentially irritating for sensitive skin. Tea tree oil also kills bacteria and decreases inflammation and redness.
Hyaluronic acid: When spread on pimple patches, this popular skin-care ingredient “helps to hydrate the skin, which helps to prevent drying from salicylic acid,” said King.
Niacinamide: “Another great addition,” Dr. King said, to a pimple patch because it can “improve skin tone and texture, and it has stabilizing effects on the skin’s barrier function, which can help improve moisture retention.” Niacinamide is a version of vitamin B3 (niacin).
Benzoyl peroxide: “Benzoyl peroxide is an antiseptic that’s been used to treat acne for decades; however, it is best to avoid it if you have experienced prior irritation to it,” said Marisa Grassick, M.D., a dermatologist at Medical Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery (MDCS) in New York City. Benzoyl peroxide helps reduce breakouts by acting as an antiseptic, killing bacteria in and around the pimple.
Salicylic acid, Benzoyl Peroxide, and Niacinamide
Types of Patches

Use a hydrocolloid bandage if your pimple is raised or has visible pus, so it can drain the fluid and flatten the pimple. 

“These patches are effective because they absorb excess fluid and have a vacuum-like effect that gets out any dirt and oil that could be causing a breakout,” said Debra Jaiman, M.D., a New York City dermatologist and the author of Skin Rules. “It then converts those impurities into a gel-like substance that sticks to the patch and is sealed away from the face.”

If your pimple is too wet, however, it can keep the bandage from adhering. If your pimple doesn’t have any fluid in it, a hydrocolloid patch won’t do much. 

“Pimple patches that contain ingredients that help treat the breakout, like salicylic acid, might deliver some extra help to clear dirt and bacteria out of pores and speed clearing,” said Dr. Jaiman.

Another type of pimple patch is the microneedle patch. It has several tiny, fine spikes that help deliver the active ingredients deeper into the skin. The arrangement is relatively more effective due to better delivery of skin-care ingredients. The active ingredients are able to more easily reach the site allowing the skin cells to absorb them.

Types of Pimple Patches
Hydrocolloid
(nonmedicated)

Coated with gel-forming agents that help to form moistness around the problem area and draw excess oil and pus out of the pimple.
Useful for blemishes that have come to a head and are ready to pop.

Medicated

Infused with ingredients that have mild medical properties.

Targets bacteria and inflammation.

Microneedling

Equipped with several tiny, fine spikes that help deliver the active ingredients deeper into the skin.
Ideal for blind pimples, which are deep bumps that form under the skin. They can be nearly invisible, small, or large, red, and painful.

Popular and Efficient

According to Brendan Camp, M.D., a dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology, pimple patches are seeing a rise in popularity for several reasons, such as “the increase in COVID masking, or the result of excess acne-causing bacteria in the area of the face that lies underneath a standard face mask, that is, the nose, cheeks, and chin. In addition, the self-care movement has taken off as more people spend time at home and find ways to better themselves and their skin.”

Pimple patches are also convenient, replacing a thick lotion or gel over the pimples for a skin-colored patch and making the breakout less visible. The market for pimple patches was valued at $510 million in 2021, indicating their prevalent use and convenience.

All things considered, pimple patches are popular and efficient.

There are 36 variable size patches so you can cover different size spots. They are sealed in a sterile pouch. The patches are transparent but with slight tan color so it blends well with my skin. Seems like it is working great, happy to have gotten it so fast!

Put them on and used them over night the next morning i noticed my skin was drier than normal and more red. By the next day the skin of where the patch was was burning, red, and flaking like crazy! It basically broke my skin barrier and made my acne way worse than before

I Replaced My Skin-Care Routine With $129 Worth Of Starface Products
KARINA HOSHIKAWA
LAST UPDATED MAY 13, 2023, 6:37 AM
You've heard of Starface, right? The viral, social media-friendly acne care brand that singlehandedly made pimple patches the ultimate selfie moment. Founded in 2019 by veteran beauty editor Julie Schott and Brian Bordainick (who have also founded other startups, such as Julie, Futurewise, among others), Starface was ahead of its time when it embarked on a mission to make acne products fun, effective, and affordable. Sparking joy (and removing the stigma of having a breakout) one acne patch at a time? Starface proved it's possible.
Unsurprisingly, the brand eventually caught the attention of major retailers like Target, Revolve, and Amazon, with over 77 million yellow Hydro-Stars being sold since its launch. But as Starface's offerings expanded to include everything from cleansers to moisturizers to sunscreen, I was curious to see how other products compared to the OG star patches that put them on the map. Ahead, join me as I try a full routine featuring Starface's best and brightest products.

Hydro-Stars + Big Yellow, $14.99
SHOP THIS
STARFACE
Hydro-stars® + Big Yellow
BUY
$14.99
STARFACE
Naturally, I had to start with Starface's hero product, the Hydro-Stars. I know you're not supposed to judge a book by its cover, but if I did? Let's just say that the bar has been set high. The magnetic compact (with a built-in mirror) is total genius (not to mention practical), and the star-shaped patches aren't just adorable but also help adhere to the shape of your zit. Compared to other patches I've tried (and I've tried many), I'd say that these fall somewhere in the middle of the pack. They must be applied on dry, clean skin in order to stay on, and I found that these worked best on breakouts that already were partially extracted (i.e., had an escape hatch to drain the contents of the pimple) rather than ones that had yet to come to a head. However, one of the best things about pimple patches is that they physically prevent the wearer from picking — and the more you can encourage people to wear them (aka, make them cute), the better. For $15, you can get 32 patches plus the refillable case, which I think is pretty well-priced. (Refill packs are $11, so hang onto that compact.)
Hydro-Stars + Big Blue, $16.99
SHOP THIS
STARFACE
Hydro-stars® + Big Blue
BUY
$16.99
STARFACE
Starface just welcomed Big Blue to its star-studded (heh) lineup this month, and I already feel like it's going to be a fan fave. They're the same Hydro-Stars you know and love but infused with salicylic acid to delve into deeper breakouts. (Plus, the patches are reimagined in sky blue, which is one of my biggest color crushes — so much so that I own a suit in the color.) Compared to the original Hydro-Stars, Big Blue patches may have sped up healing time but not by a crazy margin. That said, as anyone with acne knows, days turn into weeks into months of not having clear skin — and it adds up. These clock in ever so slightly more expensive than their yellow sistren but are a good option to have on hand for more stubborn breakouts.

Space Wash, $10.99
SHOP THIS
STARFACE
Space Wash
BUY
$10.99
STARFACE
IMO, a cleanser only needs to do one thing, and do it well: Get your skin clean without over-stripping. Space Wash was perfect, in this sense: It's a really good, no-frills gel-to-foam formula that left my face feeling fresh and balanced. It's not jam-packed with buzzy active ingredients, and TBH, it doesn't need to be. (I personally recommend investing in serums and moisturizers that stay on your skin for more than 30 seconds.) I have oily skin, and even a tiny amount of cleanser lathered up enough to leave me feeling super clean. And especially for the price? Space Wash is a solid product that feels more expensive than its $11 tag.
Exfoliating Night Water, $11.99
SHOP THIS
STARFACE
Exfoliating Night Water
BUY
$11.99
STARFACE
I used to swear by toners, but as my routine has pared down a bit, I phased it out and never looked back. However, a recent facialist encouraged me to step things up in the exfoliation department, so back it went. Starface's Exfoliating Night Water was clear with a slight yellow tint and a fun press-top, which was perfect for pressing with a cotton pad or reusable round to absorb the liquid. Despite having a trifecta of AHAs, BHAs, and PHAs, it felt gentler on my face than other liquid exfoliants I've tried — which were ahem, spicy, to say the least. After a few weeks of testing, I do feel like my texture has improved a bit, but more time will tell if this stuff helps my hyperpigmentation and other acne scars. But for the price? The only other thing that rivals it is my other favorite liquid exfoliator, The Ordinary's Glycolic Acid toner.

I live in Miami, so I take sunscreen very seriously. Because I'm very acne-prone, I usually stick to mineral formulas that don't piss off my skin. Starface's Clear As Day is a chemical formula, but it didn't break me out once. True to the name, the formula itself was clear and gel-like, with a silky matte finish that felt like a makeup primer. (I hesitate to call it a "dupe" of another popular clear sunscreen but can also see the similarities.) I loved how this stuff didn't leave any sort of weird cast and toned down shine within seconds of applying. I also love a high SPF, so this will definitely be in my bag for touch-ups this summer.

My fellow oily folks will hear me on this: Nothing works better than a clay mask to sop up grease and impurities on the skin. (And hello, the satisfaction of seeing tiny pinpricks of oil as the mask dries? Bliss.) For starters, I love that Super Sulfur came in a tube. This makes it so much easier to dispense and takes up less room than a bulky jar. It's also light blue (see note above) and has kaolin clay, blueberry extract, and sulfur to naturally decongest pores. There's no tingling or burning sensation, either. (And before you ask, yes, there is a slight smell but nothing too crazy.) During a recent spa night in, my fiancé and I used this while watching Succession and emerged with bright, balanced complexions. (I swear, it even scared away a pimple-in-the-making that was brewing on my chin.) At $19, it's among the pricier products in the Starface lineup, but one I'll be glad to have on hand this summer.

ICYMI, Starface makes body wash, too. For starters, I loved the pouch packaging — so quirky, sustainable, and fun. (If you want, you can decant it into a reusable bottle, but it's totally optional since there's a cap.) Outer Space had a pale green tint and a subtly fresh scent that wasn't too perfumy but also was refreshing in my morning shower. In keeping with Starface's acne-focused M.O., Outer Space does contain ingredients (these include willow bark, cica, and mild AHAs) to help keep body breakouts at bay and soften skin. It feels like a true treat to use, and as someone who has historically neglected the skin below the neck, has seriously leveled up my body care routine.

As I wrap up my Starface journey, I want to end with what emerged as a dark horse in my review: Micro-Cloud. These micropoint patches might be tied for first with Big Blue in terms of my favorite Starface products. As someone who is prone to underground, irritated breakouts, I've found a lot of success with patches that have tiny pinpricks to deliver ingredients deep into the pimple for fast healing. Starface's version is powered by a one-two punch of niacinamide and salicylic acid (two ingredients I love and use in my routine), and sure enough, they stopped a particularly nasty nose pimple right in its tracks. And this is all before we even talk about how adorable the little cloud design is — I was prepared to call B.S. if they didn't work and were just cute, but truly, I have no notes. Short of having a dermatologist on speed dial for an emergency cortisone shot, these patches are a true lifeline before a date, big event, or any other occasion where you don't want your pimple third-wheeling.

ACNE BRANDS CAPITALIZING ON THE “ICK FACTOR” AS A RECIPE FOR TIKTOK SUCCESS
CRISTINA MONTEMAYOR
PUBLISHED APRIL 24, 2022
FEATURE SKINCARE MARKETING
Rabizo via Canva

Since the dawn of the internet, “oddly satisfying” videos have captivated people’s attention. Pimple-popping videos are among the oldest and most popular types of strangely satisfying content that people love to watch (or love to hate-watch). 

Internet historians trace the origin of the trend back to 2015 with Dr. Pimple Popper’s viral videos, but even after seven years and a network television show, people still aren’t sick of these ick-inducing videos. TikTok dermatologists are capitalizing on the trend, posting their reaction to some close-up videos of pimple popping, blackhead squeezing, and cyst squashing, racking up millions of views in their expert dissection of another’s expert dissection. 

While watching these videos through half-shut eyes is somewhat satisfying, it’s even more satisfying to experience the ick IRL. Pimple patches allow people to take their overfilled zits into their own hands and experience the visual and physical relief of popping a pimple sans scalpel. Pimple patches have soared in popularity over the last few years, with searches expected to grow 30% over the next 12 months according to Spate.

Acne brands selling pimple patches are tapping into the pimple-popping trend to showcase the effectiveness of their products, and seeing incredible engagement and conversion on these engrossing videos. BeautyMatter spoke to four acne brands to understand how they make the most of this long-standing trend and why they believe it resonates so deeply with their customers and on social. 

Peace Out Skincare has been on a mission to erase the stigma surrounding acne since the brand launched in 2017—long before acne positivity entered the beauty zeitgeist. The brand’s best-selling acne patches were the first on the market to combine active ingredients with a medical grade hydrocolloid polymer, leading to more than 35 million patches sold worldwide. Peace Out’s honest and relatable approach to acne has made the brand wildly popular on TikTok, garnering 90.1K followers and 2.6MM likes. 

The ​​#peaceoutskincare tag has over 26.1MM views, with nearly all of the most popular videos falling into the “oddly satisfying” content category, showing the overfilled pore strips and pimple patches. Junior Pence, Chief Marketing Officer and Creative Director at Peace Out, says that these videos were primarily user-generated in the beginning.

“We got early into understanding the ‘gross’ effect of Peace Out Acne Dots,” says Pence. “It started out as all organic UGC. Our consumers, people that know our brand and love our brand, put it up there themselves.”

Peace Out seeds product to nano and micro influencers, many of whom have posted about the brand before. The brand strives to build and nurture these relationships, believing them to be more fruitful than paid promotions with large influencers. 

“We've always believed that the micro influencer is the number one influencer that you could possibly ever have. It’s all about honesty and integrity,” says Pence. “What we learn from our consumers and our customers when they give us feedback is that they will only trust a nano influencer.”

“We got early into understanding the ‘gross’ effect of Peace Out Acne Dots.”
BY JUNIOR PENCE, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER + CREATIVE DIRECTOR, PEACE OUT

Pence says that the brand only receives positive feedback on the “gross” videos they share of customers using their products. In fact, the videos have been so successful that the brands use them in paid social ads, where they continuously have a click-through rate of around 7%, as opposed to average 3.4%.  

“We've never got pushback on showing the product or being honest about what happens when you use the product because that's the benefit of the product, watching the gunk being sucked into the hydrocolloid.”

One of their more recent viral videos is a 20-second close-up video showing someone removing an acne patch, revealing the juicy inside. The video has racked up over 3.2 million views and over 289,000 likes. Pence says this speaks to the consumer demand for authenticity in marketing, especially in skincare. 

“I think they're looking for [brands] to be authentic, and to know that you're actually telling the truth about what your product is and what it does. What is the benefit of using this product?” says Pence. “At the end of the day, that's the biggest feedback we get. People love our product because it does what it says it does in the least amount of time so that they can go back to feeling good about themselves.”

Peace Out isn’t the only acne brand capitalizing on the popularity of these #oddlysatisfying videos. ZitSticka, a skincare brand known for its acne patches, sees higher engagement on these videos versus others.

“There’s a kind of visceral satisfaction in seeing, say, the contents of your zit extracted or a hyper-macro video of a hair being tweezed,” says Melissa Kenny, Director of Communications at ZitSticka. “It feels almost primal, but also difficult to trace! This category of content definitely arouses a good deal of interest/interaction for ZitSticka on TikTok (as well as Instagram) which might be explained as being cathartic or stress-relieving for some.”

For COSRX, the Korean skincare brand credited for being the first to market with the iconic Acne Pimple Master Patch, sees a deeper explanation for the popularity of these videos.

“Social media is a diary of our collective unconscious,” a representative from the skincare brand tells BeautyMatter. “The oddly satisfying videos reflect our wider sentiments, preferences, and desires. People can't stop watching these satisfying videos because they are projecting themselves onto the person in the video who’s pulling off an acne pimple patch from their skin.”

Bioré Skincare is best known for its classic pore strip, which predates the acne patch craze of recent years by at least decade. The Biore tag on TikTok is filled with examples of this trend, garnering over 88 million views. The brand knows exactly why consumers keep coming back to the iconic pore strip: the satisfaction of clean and clear pores.

“There’s something about people sharing their stripping experience—and the gunk that comes with it—that consumers just can’t get enough of,” says Leah Stone, Associate Director of Face Care at Bioré Skincare. “Watching up-close and personal content of others clearing out their pores can evoke feelings of fulfillment and productivity, and can even inspire the viewer to take action when it comes to their own skin. There is also a sense of community when it comes to these videos—they bring a certain comfort to some viewers in knowing they’re not alone in their skin struggles, and all who watch them share that same intrigue and craving for a satisfying experience.”

Sonia Elyss, beauty marketing strategist and President and founder of Round Twelve, a digital marketing consultancy, explains why she believes these types of videos overperform on TikTok. 

“While I do believe there is an audience that truly enjoys and feels that odd sense of satisfaction from this up-close-and-personal look at something that is deemed ‘gross,’ many others just have to slow down to watch, even though they truly feel it IS gross,” says Elyss. “Consider the car crash effect. Most people don't actually want to see anything gruesome, but everyone slows down to watch! As we watch and rewatch TikTok's algorithm picks up on our ‘interest’ in the content distributing it to others on the platform at a faster rate.”

Most people will never experience an extraction worthy of Dr. Pimple Popper, and that’s probably a good thing. But most people will experience the occasional pimple, and when they do, there may be a small part of them that feels giddy at the excuse to see a pimple patch at its fullest potential. Even if you don’t find watching these videos on TikTok #oddlysatisfying, when it happens to you, it’s just plain satisfying.

Editor’s Note: We reviewed this article on September 24, 2023. As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.

Period, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren't blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month. 

Lucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I'll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.

Keep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.

COSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH

BEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types

KEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid

PRICE: $19

ABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.

About My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts

My skin can be unpredictable. But, as I've gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.  

Ingredients: One key, familiar ingredient 

The tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.

The Feel: Like a bandage

You can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Packaging: Easy to store

The 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish

I placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.

Even with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn't budge overnight.

If you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn't expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn't gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don't believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Value: Worth it

Was this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

Similar Products: You've got options

Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Variety Pack ($7): These 36 count medical-grade, chemical-free, allergy-tested patches stay put no matter how much you toss and turn throughout the night. 

Final Verdict

If you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won't regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.

 NIce and effective
Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2023
Size: 120 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
I recently purchased the KEYCONCEPTS Pimple Patches for Face, and I must say I'm quite pleased with my purchase. This 120-pack of hydrocolloid patches with tea tree oil has been a game-changer in my skincare routine. Here's my average review of this product:

Effectiveness (4/5):
These patches work wonders when it comes to reducing the size and redness of pimples. The hydrocolloid material does an excellent job of drawing out impurities and excess oil from the blemish. The added tea tree oil provides a soothing and antibacterial effect, which helps speed up the healing process. I've noticed a significant improvement in the appearance of my pimples after using these patches consistently.

Ease of Use (5/5):
Applying these patches is a breeze. They adhere well to the skin and stay in place throughout the day or night. The different sizes in the pack make it easy to choose the right one for the pimple's size, ensuring a secure fit. Plus, they are transparent, so they blend seamlessly with the skin, making them discreet to wear in public.

Quantity (5/5):
This 120-pack is a fantastic value for the price. With so many patches included, I feel like I'm well-prepared for any unexpected breakouts. It's convenient not to have to reorder frequently.

Skin-Friendly (4/5):
While the patches are generally gentle on the skin, I did notice some minor irritation on particularly sensitive areas of my face after extended use. However, this could vary from person to person, and it wasn't a widespread issue for me.

Overall, the KEYCONCEPTS Pimple Patches for Face have become a staple in my skincare routine. They effectively tackle pimples, are easy to use, and offer great value for the quantity provided. I would recommend these hydrocolloid patches with tea tree oil to anyone looking for an effective solution to combat blemishes and speed up the healing process.

 Seriously Effective!
Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2023
Size: 120 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
These pimple patches are great! My partner and I use pimple patches all the time, as we both have frequent and often problematic breakouts. As such, we've tried dozens of brands and I have to say, these are by far the best. As soon as you open the package, you can smell the tea tree oil on them so you can tell they're the real deal. They have three different sizes- ranging from extra large, medium large, and then a small-ish medium. I know those sizes sound weird but if you see them, you'll understand. The smallest size is really not all that small. They also aren't the most discrete patches I've used as they aren't a perfect clear and they discolor fairly quickly during use. That being said, I'm more than happy to deal with the visibility because they last forever with very strong adhesion and they WORK. They ACTUALLY work! I leave mine on as long as I can and by the time I'm ready to take them off, my pimples are smaller if not completely drained of sebum. I can't recommend them enough!

 Pure magic.
Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2023
Size: 120 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
These things are bananas. Not sure how they work, but they do. I use tweezers to take them off the sheet so they don't stick to themselves (you know what I mean, like a bandaid does sometimes) and they stay on perfectly. If your skin is oily, you may want to wipe it off first with an astringent so the patch stays on better.

I'm almost 40 and occasionally get a pimple here and there. Put one of these on at the first sight of one and it's immediately getting rid of the yuck. Sometimes it takes a few days, sometimes it takes a few hours, but you can visibly see the progress. Teenager in the house and we both swear by these. 100% recommend.

 Average Pimple Patches - Decent but Not Outstanding
Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023
Size: 120 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
I recently tried the KEYCONCEPTS Pimple Patches for Face (120 Pack), and here's my honest three-star review:

Effectiveness (3/5): These patches do an okay job when it comes to treating pimples. They help with absorbing the gunk and reducing inflammation, but I found that they were not as effective as some other brands I've used in the past. It often took longer for my pimples to fully heal when using these patches.

Pack Size (4/5): The 120-pack is quite generous, and you get a lot of patches for the price. However, if you're someone who only occasionally deals with pimples, this might be more than you need. I wish there was an option for a smaller pack size.

Adhesion (3/5): The adhesion of these patches is decent but not exceptional. They stick well initially, but I noticed that they tend to peel off easily if applied on oily skin or areas prone to movement, like around the mouth. Other brands I've tried had better staying power.

Now, let me compare these KEYCONCEPTS Pimple Patches to some other brands I've used:

Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch (4/5): These patches are slightly more effective in my experience. They seem to work faster in reducing the size and redness of pimples. However, they are a bit thinner and less discreet than KEYCONCEPTS patches.

Nexcare Acne Absorbing Covers (3.5/5): Similar in effectiveness to KEYCONCEPTS patches, but they have better adhesion. They stay in place even on oily skin, which is a big plus.

Mighty Patch Original (4/5): These patches are very effective and have excellent adhesion. However, they are pricier than KEYCONCEPTS patches.

In summary, the KEYCONCEPTS Pimple Patches are decent but not outstanding in terms of effectiveness and adhesion. While the pack size is generous, they could be more effective, especially compared to some other options on the market. If you're looking for a more budget-friendly option and don't mind waiting a bit longer for results, these could be a suitable choice. However, if you want quicker and more reliable results, you might want to consider other brands with a higher rating.

 Not for use on deep cystic acne
Reviewed in Canada on October 16, 2023
Size: 120 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
In order for these to work well , the acne must be either near or at the surface. If so, these are satisfyingly good at drawing out all the gunk building up in your pores.

I liked the amount of patches for the price ! I didn’t like that the sizes were all mixed throughout the 3 packages. Might find it better to have each size on each sheet so you can get the size you need easier

 Very good pimple patches
Reviewed in Canada on September 6, 2023
Size: 120 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
These are great value and work well. The only reason I gave a 4 and not a 5 is that they show more than other brands so I use only at night (which is ideal time anyways), also the sticker is so sticky that it sometimes peeled away soft skin.

Reviewed in Canada on October 12, 2023
Size: 120 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
These types of products are often a hit or miss on if they will actually do what they’re advertised to do. Very satisfied with these!

Easy to place (and STAYED in place!), you can SEE it working at drawing out the pimple, and easily, painlessly removable.

10/10 would recommend, even for sensitive skin.

When I emailed cosmetic chemist Victoria Fu on the subject, she confirmed my suspicion. “Hydrocolloid dressings have been around for a while,” Victoria explains, “and they’re all generally made in the same way.” Basically, there’s a special congealing liquid that’s combined with adhesive, and the mixture is applied to a plastic sheet. Sometimes, Victoria notes, acne-fighting ingredients are added to the adhesive-hydrocolloid mixture, but this doesn’t exactly do much. “You’re better off applying your regular acne treatments before applying the dressing,” says Victoria.\n\nThickness is another thing that doesn’t really matter—thick or thin patches shrink pimples at the same rate. In fact, the only variable you need to keep in mind is how well the patch sticks to your skin . “With good adherence,” Victoria explains, “a hydrocolloid can create an enclosed, moist, protected environment for hours and even days.”\n\nYou won\'t find any patches with attachment issues below. And then I further refined the list, based on price, size, and translucence. Some are more matte than others for invisible daily wear, some are big, some are tiny, some have funky shapes and colors. But enough of that, your perfect pack awaits.\n\nThe Cheapest: Peach Slices + Alba Botanica\n\nUnlike sometimes pricey spot treatments, pimple patches don’t need to be expensive to work. Both Peach Slices and Alba Botanica’s versions net out to under $.20 per patch (15 and 18 respectively). And while Peach Slices is definitely the cheapest, Alba’s is more matte—perfect for daytime use. Plus, both are easy to buy IRL in a pinch—Peach Slices is sold at CVS, while Alba is at Target.\n\nThe Most Invisible: Rael\n\nIt doesn’t matter what a patch looks like when you’re wearing it to bed. When you want to wear it to work, it’s a different story—shiny patches stand out from skin or makeup, but matte ones go more or less undetected. These Rael patches have a slightly thinner outer edge to blend into skin, and the plastic laminate has a powdery, matte finish that’s not too conspicuous. It’s the best choice options for keeping your zit protected and treated during work hours.\n\nThe Cleanest Application: Avarelle\n\nA big part of making sure your patch adheres well is how you apply it. Some patches, when you try to seperate them from their plastic backing, ball up on the side and create a bump that doesn’t lay flat. These Avarelle patches are packaged on a clear, perforated plastic sheet that you can fold and peel off while keeping the patch itself intact. It comes in classic, AM and PM versions (the AM versions are smaller and less obvious, and they’re infused with different anti-acne ingredients), but since the additives don’t make much of a difference, you can pick at random—I like the classic version for no reason in particular. All three variations come with the same great backing.\n\nThe One For Cysts: ZitSticka Killa Patches\n\nNot a hydrocolloid, ZitSticka’s patches consist of a plastic cover, an adhesive ring, and a pad of salicylic acid and niacinamide microdarts meant to penetrate the epidermis and reach deep into those painful, under-the-skin pimples. Other pimple patch brands make cystic acne-fighting patches with microdarts, but ZitSticka’s are the sturdiest and feel the most comfortable on skin. The darts are the biggest, but the patch itself is slim and adheres well. They’re also the least conspicuous of the microdart patches, if you’re into wearing them out. ZitSticka’s patches are also the most expensive on this list, and come in pretty silly packaging—half of the pack is individually wrapped Killa patches, and the other half is filled with cleaning pads, which I’d recommend you skip. (Rubbing alcohol on cystic pimples only dries out the top layer of skin and traps the infection down there for longer.) Still, if you’ve tried everything you can for cysts and still can’t get relief, these are worth a try—not only do they reduce the size of the cyst, but they also prevent you from picking and making it worse.\n\nThe Best XL: Hero Mighty Patch Surface\n\nOut of all the large acne patches I tried, the Mighty Patch Surfaces were by far the best—large enough to cover a couple close-together back zits, and sturdy enough to stay put through a shower and outfit changes. They also do a great job of being invisible, despite the large size. But that being said, if you don’t care about it blending in, Band-Aid Hydro Seal Blister Heels are of comparable size and sturdiness, and one pack costs a third as much at the drugstore.\n\nThe Cute One: Starface\n\nThe one to wear when you don’t want your coworkers staring at your face thinking, ‘Is that a pimple patch?’ They\'re star-shaped and yellow and quite conspicuous, but that’s the point! They\'re very cute. Recently, I’ve been relying on these the most for daytime—and now when a zit pops up on my cheek, I actually get excited about it. Is that weird? A bonus perk is that it’s nearly impossible to lose the little yellow pod they come in, a problem I’ve noticed with the slim sheets of other packages. Peel it off gently to avoid wrinkling any of the star points.\n\n—Ali Oshinsky\n\nPhoto via ITG\n\nSHARETWEETPINCOPY\nMore:\nACNE\nSKINCARE\nWEIRD SKINCARE\nEVERYTHING ACNE\nDON\'T MISSMost Popular\nTHE EXTRAS\nHow To Be A Person Who Has Their Life Together\nOPEN THREAD\nWhat\'s Everyone Reading?\nTHE REVIEW\nFor Every Top Shelf, There’s a Bottom Shelf\nGUIDE\nHow Not To Mess Up Your At-Home Hair Color\nTHE EXTRAS\nThe Makeup Bags Of Glossier HQ: Extreme Makeover Edition\nGUIDE\nFind Your Tinted Moisturizer Soulmate\nSign up for email updates (including Into The Gloss stories and event invites, plus Glossier launches and product info).

But now that I’m in my early 30s (33 is still considered early, right?), my jaw has become a minefield of hormonal, cystic pimples that flare up at the first sign of PMS. Yay.\n\n\nThis content is imported from poll. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nYou wouldn’t know it by looking at me, though, because my zits so rarely come to a head—they just live deep inside, haunting me, so painful and hot that I sit there dreaming about cutting them out (dark, but true). Which is why I was stoked to hear about ZitSticka, a new acne patch specifically designed to treat below-the-surface pimples before they take over your face. And, to see if they were really worth the hype, I tested them out in the name of science clear skin.\n\nZitSticka Killa Kit\n$29 AT ZITSTICKA.COM\nCredit: Courtesy Image\n\nTHE PATCH DEETS\n\nMore From Cosmopolitan\n\xa0\n\n“But I’m already obsessed with acne patches!” you cry. And, hey, same. But these are different than the hydrocolloid bandages you’ve been using from, say, Peach & Lily or CosRx. Because unlike traditional patches, which only work on zits that have already “popped” (so they can absorb fluid from the pimple), ZitSticka’s patches treat unpopped, underground zits using itty-bitty, medication-filled micro-darts. Stay with me, here.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nRelated Stories\nHow to Easily Get (or Fake) Thicker Brows\nI Tried That Viral Boob Mask From Instagram\nGuess How Often You Should Wash Your Hair?\n\nThe patch—aptly named Killa—looks like a regular hydrocolloid bandage, but with one key difference: Its sticky surface is covered with 24 dissolvable micro-darts that gently penetrate the stratum corneum and epidermis (your top two layers of skin) to push medication into your pimple. Each dart is filled with acne-fighting and skin-healing ingredients, including hyaluronic acid (to moisturize), niacinamide (to calm inflammation), salicylic acid (to loosen and break down the pimple), and oligopeptide-76 (to kill bacteria).\n\nEach Killa Kit contains eight individually packaged patches and eight pre-treat wipes (soaked with salicylic acid, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and alcohol to sanitize skin and add an extra acne-killing punch before you slap on the patch). Just dab the pimple with a wipe, let it dry for a few seconds, then stick on the patch and live your life.\n\nSee the tiny micro-darts on the sticky side of the patch?\nCourtesy Image\n\nWTF IT FELT LIKE\n\nIf you’ve used hydrocolloid patches before, you know there’s nothing more satisfying than seeing it turn white from a pimple’s gunk. It’s one of the gross-but-amazing parts of skincare. Sadly, you’re not going to get that with Killa; the darts aren’t actually permeating the zit’s core (it’s impossible to pop cystic pimples from the surface), so they won’t really draw out any gunk overnight.\n\nStill, I was surprised by how incredibly satisfying the patch felt when I applied it—like I was doing something productive for my pimple. After washing my face and wiping down my most painful cystic zit, I pressed on the Killa patch, holding it for 15 seconds, as recommended, to help it really adhere. The darts actually do feel prickly when you first press on the patch—kind of like a piece of velcro against your skin—but the whole thing is more uncomfortable than it is painful. The brand recommends leaving the patch on for at least two hours to allow the darts to fully dissolve, but I decided to apply it right before bed to give it a full seven hours to work.\n\nTHE RESULTS\n\nPart of me didn’t expect this patch to work at all (I’ve seen too many gimmicks), but by the time I woke up and peeled it off, my zit was noticeably calmer. The warmth and redness that had been radiating from it the night before were diminished—it was now just a pink, barely painful bump. In fact, within 48 hours, the zit had cleared up completely, as if I had gotten a cortisone injection from my derm.\n\nMy underground zit before the sticker (left), and immediately after (right) I removed the sticker the following morning.\nElizabeth Denton\n\nI was legitimately shocked these patches worked so well, so I went to experts to find out, well, why. Was I just a lucky case? According to dermatologist Mona Gohara, MD, associate clinical professor at Yale University (and not affiliated with ZitSticka), the niacinamide (vitamin B3) in each micro-dart was the “magic ingredient” for my cyst. “Niacinamide is a potent anti-inflammatory that’s sometimes prescribed as an oral medication because it’s so effective,” she says, noting that it becomes even more powerful when combined with hyaluronic acid, which “pushes in moisture to reduce irritation.” Basically, she’s not surprised Killa worked so well for me.\n\nCourtesy\n\nWILL IT WORK FOR YOU?\n\nHere’s the thing about Killa: It’s not an acne cure. Though the micro-darts are effective at penetrating the first two layers of skin, Dr. Gohara says the ingredients seem less effective at treating and healing pimples, and more effective at reducing the inflammation within a pimple—which, in turn, can help your body heal it faster on its own.\n\nSo what does all this mean for you? Killa patches won’t replace your skincare routine—you’ll still need a good cleanser and zit-fighting regimen—nor should they, considering a box of eight patches and wipes retails for $29, which, if you’re using them daily, will add up fast. Still, when you’ve got the occasional underground zit and don’t have the time (or money) to run to the derm for an injection, you can use these patches to help reduce the redness and swelling of a pimple fast. And that, as far as I’m concerned, is worth all of the micro-darts and money in the world.\n\nThis content is imported from poll.

And what evil thing can spring up because of it? Acne.\n\nPost up your remedies, stories, or anything involving those red buggers that show up on first dates.\n\n\nI\'ll start. I\'ve suffered from acne for years now, but it was stationed only in a small patch on my chest and back. No biggie, right? Well the beginning of this school year has brought on some spreadage...I don\'t know what caused it. Possibly increased testosterone levels? \n\n\nRegardless, the patch on my chest spread to the one on my back, and in recent weeks, it\'s crawled up the neck. What\'s a guy to do? I started taking Sulphur derivatives because I heard that worked. I tried natural remedies like honey and vinegar, but had no luck with that. Even products that you see on TV or on the shelves, but they didn\'t work either. I researched it a bit and discovered retinol, a derivative of vitamin A, and I had been taking vitamin A pills for a couple weeks now. I stopped for a week because of march break: vitamin a + drinking = not good, since they both go straight to the liver, so that\'s my reason for stopping.\n\n\nAfter march break I started up again, but this time I broke out like mad. That was the last draw, so accutane starts today.\n lilwalters\n\nO+\n\t\nPosted: Mar 25, 2008 at 15:48\tQuote\ni disagree... sweating cleans out your pores... just make sure you shower before it re-absorbs... saunas are real good for this too...\n woody\n\n\t\nPosted: Mar 25, 2008 at 15:50\tQuote\n\nlilwalters wrote:\ni disagree... sweating cleans out your pores... just make sure you shower before it re-absorbs... saunas are real good for this too...\n\n\n\tPeople who experience hyperhidrosis may also notice that increased sweating affects their acne. Up to 20% of sufferers notice that their acne flares up after excessive sweating. The most probable cause of acne in these patients is a result of water swelling an already existing obstruction in the hair duct which in turn causes a complete blockage and inflammation.\n\nhttp://www.hyperhidrosis.us/acne.php\n dhrunner\n\n\t\nPosted: Mar 25, 2008 at 15:51\tQuote\nSome people are just simply more prone to it than others.

The viral, social media-friendly acne care brand that singlehandedly made pimple patches the ultimate selfie moment. Founded in 2019 by veteran beauty editor Julie Schott and Brian Bordainick (who have also founded other startups, such as Julie, Futurewise, among others), Starface was ahead of its time when it embarked on a mission to make acne products fun, effective, and affordable. Sparking joy (and removing the stigma of having a breakout) one acne patch at a time? Starface proved it\'s possible.\nUnsurprisingly, the brand eventually caught the attention of major retailers like Target, Revolve, and Amazon, with over 77 million yellow Hydro-Stars being sold since its launch. But as Starface\'s offerings expanded to include everything from cleansers to moisturizers to sunscreen, I was curious to see how other products compared to the OG star patches that put them on the map. Ahead, join me as I try a full routine featuring Starface\'s best and brightest products.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nHydro-Stars + Big Yellow, $14.99\nSHOP THIS\nSTARFACE\nHydro-stars® + Big Yellow\nBUY\n$14.99\nSTARFACE\nNaturally, I had to start with Starface\'s hero product, the Hydro-Stars. I know you\'re not supposed to judge a book by its cover, but if I did? Let\'s just say that the bar has been set high. The magnetic compact (with a built-in mirror) is total genius (not to mention practical), and the star-shaped patches aren\'t just adorable but also help adhere to the shape of your zit. Compared to other patches I\'ve tried (and I\'ve tried many), I\'d say that these fall somewhere in the middle of the pack. They must be applied on dry, clean skin in order to stay on, and I found that these worked best on breakouts that already were partially extracted (i.e., had an escape hatch to drain the contents of the pimple) rather than ones that had yet to come to a head. However, one of the best things about pimple patches is that they physically prevent the wearer from picking —\xa0and the more you can encourage people to wear them (aka, make them cute), the better. For $15, you can get 32 patches plus the refillable case, which I think is pretty well-priced. (Refill packs are $11, so hang onto that compact.)\nHydro-Stars + Big Blue, $16.99\nSHOP THIS\nSTARFACE\nHydro-stars® + Big Blue\nBUY\n$16.99\nSTARFACE\nStarface just welcomed Big Blue to its star-studded (heh) lineup this month, and I already feel like it\'s going to be a fan fave. They\'re the same Hydro-Stars you know and love but infused with salicylic acid to delve into deeper breakouts. (Plus, the patches are reimagined in sky blue,\xa0which is one of my biggest color crushes — so much so that I own a suit in the color.) Compared to the original Hydro-Stars, Big Blue patches may have sped up healing time but not by a crazy margin. That said, as anyone with acne knows, days turn into weeks into months of not having clear skin —\xa0and it adds up. These clock in ever so slightly more expensive than their yellow sistren but are a good option to have on hand for more stubborn breakouts.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nSpace Wash, $10.99\nSHOP THIS\nSTARFACE\nSpace Wash\nBUY\n$10.99\nSTARFACE\nIMO, a cleanser only needs to do one thing, and do it well: Get your skin clean without over-stripping. Space Wash was perfect, in this sense: It\'s a really good, no-frills gel-to-foam formula that left my face feeling fresh and balanced. It\'s not jam-packed with buzzy active ingredients, and TBH, it doesn\'t need to be. (I personally recommend investing in serums and moisturizers that stay on your skin for more than 30 seconds.) I have oily skin, and even a tiny amount of cleanser lathered up enough to leave me feeling super clean. And especially for the price? Space Wash is a solid product that feels more expensive than its $11 tag.\nExfoliating Night Water, $11.99\nSHOP THIS\nSTARFACE\nExfoliating Night Water\nBUY\n$11.99\nSTARFACE\nI used to swear by toners, but as my routine has pared down a bit, I phased it out and never looked back. However, a recent facialist encouraged me to step things up in the exfoliation department, so back it went. Starface\'s Exfoliating Night Water was clear with a slight yellow tint and a fun press-top, which was perfect for pressing with a cotton pad or reusable round to absorb the liquid. Despite having a trifecta of AHAs, BHAs, and PHAs, it felt gentler on my face than other liquid exfoliants I\'ve tried —\xa0which were ahem, spicy, to say the least. After a few weeks of testing, I do feel like my texture has improved a bit, but more time will tell if this stuff helps my hyperpigmentation and other acne scars. But for the price? The only other thing that rivals it is my other favorite liquid exfoliator, The Ordinary\'s Glycolic Acid toner.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nClear As Day SPF 46, $23.99\nSHOP THIS\nSTARFACE\nClear As Day Spf 46\nBUY\n$23.99\nSTARFACE\nI live in Miami, so I take sunscreen very seriously. Because I\'m very acne-prone, I usually stick to mineral formulas that don\'t piss off my skin. Starface\'s Clear As Day is a chemical formula, but it didn\'t break me out once. True to the name, the formula itself was clear and gel-like, with a silky matte finish that felt like a makeup primer. (I hesitate to call it a "dupe" of another popular clear sunscreen but can also see the similarities.) I loved how this stuff didn\'t leave any sort of weird cast and toned down shine within seconds of applying. I also love a high SPF, so this will definitely be in my bag for touch-ups this summer.\nSuper Sulfur Magic Mask, $18.99\nSHOP THIS\nSTARFACE\nSuper-sulfur Magic Mask\nBUY\n$18.99\nSTARFACE\nMy fellow oily folks will hear me on this: Nothing works better than a clay mask to sop up grease and impurities on the skin. (And hello, the satisfaction of seeing tiny pinpricks of oil as the mask dries? Bliss.) For starters, I love that Super Sulfur came in a tube. This makes it so much easier to dispense and takes up less room than a bulky jar. It\'s also light blue (see note above) and has kaolin clay, blueberry extract, and sulfur to naturally decongest pores. There\'s no tingling or burning sensation, either. (And before you ask, yes, there is a slight smell but nothing too crazy.) During a recent spa night in, my fiancé and I used this while watching Succession and emerged with bright, balanced complexions. (I swear, it even scared away a pimple-in-the-making that was brewing on my chin.) At $19, it\'s among the pricier products in the Starface lineup, but one I\'ll be glad to have on hand this summer.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nOuter Space Foaming Body Cleanser, $12.99\nSHOP THIS\nSTARFACE\nOuter Space Foaming Body Cleanser\nBUY\n£12.99\nSTARFACE\nICYMI, Starface makes body wash, too. For starters, I loved the pouch packaging —\xa0so quirky, sustainable, and fun. (If you want, you can decant it into a reusable bottle, but it\'s totally optional since there\'s a cap.) Outer Space had a pale green tint and a subtly fresh scent that wasn\'t too perfumy but also was refreshing in my morning shower. In keeping with Starface\'s acne-focused M.O., Outer Space does contain ingredients (these include willow bark, cica, and mild AHAs) to help keep body breakouts at bay and soften skin. It feels like a true treat to use, and as someone who has historically neglected the skin below the neck, has seriously leveled up my body care routine.\nMicro-Cloud, $17.99\nSHOP THIS\nSTARFACE\nMicro-cloud\nBUY\n$17.99\nSTARFACE\nAs I wrap up my Starface journey, I want to end with what emerged as a dark horse in my review: Micro-Cloud. These micropoint patches might be tied for first with Big Blue in terms of my favorite Starface products. As someone who is prone to underground, irritated breakouts, I\'ve found a lot of success with patches that have tiny pinpricks to deliver ingredients deep into the pimple for fast healing. Starface\'s version is powered by a one-two punch of niacinamide and salicylic acid (two ingredients I love and use in my routine), and sure enough, they stopped a particularly nasty nose pimple right in its tracks. And this is all before we even talk about how adorable the little cloud design is — I was prepared to call B.S. if they didn\'t work and were just cute, but\xa0truly, I have no notes. Short of having a dermatologist on speed dial for an emergency cortisone shot, these patches are a true lifeline before a date, big event, or any other occasion where you don\'t want your pimple third-wheeling.\nSHOP 8 PRODUCTS\nSTARFACE\nClear As Day Spf 46\nBUY\n$23.99\nSTARFACE\nSTARFACE\nHydro-stars® + Big Yellow\nBUY\n$14.99\nSTARFACE\nSTARFACE\nMicro-cloud\nBUY\n$17.99\nSTARFACE\nSTARFACE\nSpace Wash\nBUY\n$10.99\nSTARFACE\nSTARFACE\nHydro-stars® + Big Blue\nBUY\n$16.99\nSTARFACE\nSTARFACE\nOuter Space Foaming Body Cleanser\nBUY\n$12.99\nSTARFACE\nSTARFACE\nExfoliating Night Water\nBUY\n$11.99\nSTARFACE\nSTARFACE\nSuper-sulfur Magic Mask\nBUY\n$18.99\nSTARFACE\nAt Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

It stayed for about three months until I saw this tiktok saying Vaseline actually works really well. Then I did a quick search on google and google said it worked (which isnt really a very reliable ig, but I didnt really care), so I ended up trying it. It worked after two weeks of putting Vaseline on my face after using my facewash every night, and worked so fast that the results were obvious. I dont think any other factors were the cause of my rapidly reduced acne because my routine still stayed the same. So, you can try that i guess.

It stayed for about three months until I saw this tiktok saying Vaseline actually works really well. Then I did a quick search on google and google said it worked (which isnt really a very reliable ig, but I didnt really care), so I ended up trying it. It worked after two weeks of putting Vaseline on my face after using my facewash every night, and worked so fast that the results were obvious. I dont think any other factors were the cause of my rapidly reduced acne because my routine still stayed the same. So, you can try that i guess.

But for emergency, i use bandaids/acne patches to cover the most offending spot. It\'s quite effective for me, since the patch keep my hands away, conceal the redness, while also suck the liquid inside those acnes out without the need to pop them and thus, reduce the swelling. But, i need to change it several times a day.

We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.\n\nPeriod, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren\'t blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month.\xa0\n\nLucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I\'ll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.\n\nKeep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.\n\nCOSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH\n\nBEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types\n\nKEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid\n\nPRICE: $19\n\nABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.\n\nAbout My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts\n\nMy skin can be unpredictable. But, as I\'ve gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.\xa0\xa0\n\nIngredients: One key, familiar ingredient\xa0\n\nThe tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.\n\nThe Feel: Like a bandage\n\nYou can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Packaging: Easy to store\n\nThe 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish\n\nI placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.\n\nEven with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn\'t budge overnight.\n\nIf you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn\'t expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn\'t gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don\'t believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Value: Worth it\n\nWas this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nSimilar Products: You\'ve got options\xa0\n\nsquish.

Pimple-popping videos are among the oldest and most popular types of strangely satisfying content that people love to watch (or love to hate-watch).\xa0\n\nInternet historians trace the origin of the trend back to 2015 with Dr. Pimple Popper’s viral videos, but even after seven years and a network television show, people still aren’t sick of these ick-inducing videos. TikTok dermatologists are capitalizing on the trend, posting their reaction to some close-up videos of pimple popping, blackhead squeezing, and cyst squashing, racking up millions of views in their expert dissection of another’s expert dissection.\xa0\n\nWhile watching these videos through half-shut eyes is somewhat satisfying, it’s even more satisfying to experience the ick IRL. Pimple patches allow people to take their overfilled zits into their own hands and experience the visual and physical relief of popping a pimple sans scalpel. Pimple patches have soared in popularity over the last few years, with searches expected to grow 30% over the next 12 months according to Spate.\n\nAcne brands selling pimple patches are tapping into the pimple-popping trend to showcase the effectiveness of their products, and seeing incredible engagement and conversion on these engrossing videos. BeautyMatter spoke to four acne brands to understand how they make the most of this long-standing trend and why they believe it resonates so deeply with their customers and on social.\xa0\n\nPeace Out Skincare has been on a mission to erase the stigma surrounding acne since the brand launched in 2017—long before acne positivity entered the beauty zeitgeist. The brand’s best-selling acne patches were the first on the market to combine active ingredients with a medical grade hydrocolloid polymer, leading to more than 35 million patches sold worldwide. Peace Out’s honest and relatable approach to acne has made the brand wildly popular on TikTok, garnering 90.1K followers and 2.6MM likes.\xa0\n\nThe \u200b\u200b#peaceoutskincare tag has over 26.1MM views, with nearly all of the most popular videos falling into the “oddly satisfying” content category, showing the overfilled pore strips and pimple patches. Junior Pence, Chief Marketing Officer and Creative Director at Peace Out, says that these videos were primarily user-generated in the beginning.\n\n“We got early into understanding the ‘gross’ effect of Peace Out Acne Dots,” says Pence. “It started out as all organic UGC. Our consumers, people that know our brand and love our brand, put it up there themselves.”\n\nPeace Out seeds product to nano and micro influencers, many of whom have posted about the brand before. The brand strives to build and nurture these relationships, believing them to be more fruitful than paid promotions with large influencers.\xa0\n\n“We\'ve always believed that the micro influencer is the number one influencer that you could possibly ever have. It’s all about honesty and integrity,” says Pence. “What we learn from our consumers and our customers when they give us feedback is that they will only trust a nano influencer.”\n\n“We got early into understanding the ‘gross’ effect of Peace Out Acne Dots.”\nBY JUNIOR PENCE, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER + CREATIVE DIRECTOR, PEACE OUT\n\nPence says that the brand only receives positive feedback on the “gross” videos they share of customers using their products. In fact, the videos have been so successful that the brands use them in paid social ads, where they continuously have a click-through rate of around 7%, as opposed to average 3.4%. \xa0\n\n“We\'ve never got pushback on showing the product or being honest about what happens when you use the product because that\'s the benefit of the product, watching the gunk being sucked into the hydrocolloid.”\n\nOne of their more recent viral videos is a 20-second close-up video showing someone removing an acne patch, revealing the juicy inside. The video has racked up over 3.2 million views and over 289,000 likes. Pence says this speaks to the consumer demand for authenticity in marketing, especially in skincare.\xa0\n\n“I think they\'re looking for [brands] to be authentic, and to know that you\'re actually telling the truth about what your product is and what it does. What is the benefit of using this product?” says Pence. “At the end of the day, that\'s the biggest feedback we get. People love our product because it does what it says it does in the least amount of time so that they can go back to feeling good about themselves.”\n\nPeace Out isn’t the only acne brand capitalizing on the popularity of these #oddlysatisfying videos. ZitSticka, a skincare brand known for its acne patches, sees higher engagement on these videos versus others.\n\n“There’s a kind of visceral satisfaction in seeing, say, the contents of your zit extracted or a hyper-macro video of a hair being tweezed,” says Melissa Kenny, Director of Communications at ZitSticka. “It feels almost primal, but also difficult to trace! This category of content definitely arouses a good deal of interest/interaction for ZitSticka on TikTok (as well as Instagram) which might be explained as being cathartic or stress-relieving for some.”\n\nFor COSRX, the Korean skincare brand credited for being the first to market with the iconic Acne Pimple Master Patch, sees a deeper explanation for the popularity of these videos.\n\n“Social media is a diary of our collective unconscious,” a representative from the skincare brand tells BeautyMatter. “The oddly satisfying videos reflect our wider sentiments, preferences, and desires. People can\'t stop watching these satisfying videos because they are projecting themselves onto the person in the video who’s pulling off an acne pimple patch from their skin.”\n\nBioré Skincare is best known for its classic pore strip, which predates the acne patch craze of recent years by at least decade. The Biore tag on TikTok is filled with examples of this trend, garnering over 88 million views. The brand knows exactly why consumers keep coming back to the iconic pore strip: the satisfaction of clean and clear pores.\n\n“There’s something about people sharing their stripping experience—and the gunk that comes with it—that consumers just can’t get enough of,” says Leah Stone, Associate Director of Face Care at Bioré Skincare. “Watching up-close and personal content of others clearing out their pores can evoke feelings of fulfillment and productivity, and can even inspire the viewer to take action when it comes to their own skin. There is also a sense of community when it comes to these videos—they bring a certain comfort to some viewers in knowing they’re not alone in their skin struggles, and all who watch them share that same intrigue and craving for a satisfying experience.”\n\nSonia Elyss, beauty marketing strategist and President and founder of Round Twelve, a digital marketing consultancy, explains why she believes these types of videos overperform on TikTok.\xa0\n\n“While I do believe there is an audience that truly enjoys and feels that odd sense of satisfaction from this up-close-and-personal look at something that is deemed ‘gross,’ many others just have to slow down to watch, even though they truly feel it IS gross,” says Elyss. “Consider the car crash effect. Most people don\'t actually want to see anything gruesome, but everyone slows down to watch! As we watch and rewatch TikTok\'s algorithm picks up on our ‘interest’ in the content distributing it to others on the platform at a faster rate.”\n\nMost people will never experience an extraction worthy of Dr. Pimple Popper, and that’s probably a good thing. But most people will experience the occasional pimple, and when they do, there may be a small part of them that feels giddy at the excuse to see a pimple patch at its fullest potential. Even if you don’t find watching these videos on TikTok #oddlysatisfying, when it happens to you, it’s just plain satisfying.\n\n×\n\n2\nARTICLE(S) REMAINING\n\nSUBSCRIBE TODAY FOR FULL ACCESS\nRELATED\nHERO COSMETICS: RETHINKING ACNE TREATMENTS ONE PATCH AT A TIME\nAPR. 8, 2019\nERNO LASZLO: CAPTURING THE CHINESE MARKET BEAUTY PRIZE\nJAN. 23, 2019\nBEAUTY DISRUPTOR SERIES: SASKIA WILSON-BROWN ON OPEN-ACCESS SCENT\nSEP. 1, 2022\nEXPERIMENT CO-FOUNDERS ON SCIENCE BEAUTY 2.0\nFEB. 19, 2023\nPEACE OUT SKINCARE: FUTURE50 2023\nJUN. 4, 2023\nMOTIF: REPLACING TRENDS WITH SCIENCE AND RAISING THE STANDARDS OF SKINCARE\nSEP. 21, 2023\nExclusives\nARTICLES\nPODCASTS\nREPORTS\nAbout\nABOUT US\nMEMBERSHIPS\nConnect\nADVERTISING + SPONSORSHIPS\nCONTRIBUTORS, TIPS + STORIES\nMEDIA + PRESS INQUIRES\nMore\nMY ACCOUNT\nTERMS\nPRIVACY\nJoin the Newsletter\n\n\nSUBMIT\n\n\n\n     \n\n© BEAUTYMATTER 2023\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nInterested in\n\nthe latest beauty\n\nindustry insights?\n\nYES\nNO\n'}]

As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.\n\nPeriod, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren\'t blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month.\xa0\n\nLucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I\'ll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.\n\nKeep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.\n\nCOSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH\n\nBEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types\n\nKEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid\n\nPRICE: $19\n\nABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.\n\nAbout My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts\n\nMy skin can be unpredictable. But, as I\'ve gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.\xa0\xa0\n\nIngredients: One key, familiar ingredient\xa0\n\nThe tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.\n\nThe Feel: Like a bandage\n\nYou can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Packaging: Easy to store\n\nThe 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish\n\nI placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.\n\nEven with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn\'t budge overnight.\n\nIf you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn\'t expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn\'t gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don\'t believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Value: Worth it\n\nWas this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nSimilar Products: You\'ve got options\xa0\n\nsquish.

This 120-pack of hydrocolloid patches with tea tree oil has been a game-changer in my skincare routine. Here\'s my average review of this product:\n\nEffectiveness (4/5):\nThese patches work wonders when it comes to reducing the size and redness of pimples. The hydrocolloid material does an excellent job of drawing out impurities and excess oil from the blemish. The added tea tree oil provides a soothing and antibacterial effect, which helps speed up the healing process. I\'ve noticed a significant improvement in the appearance of my pimples after using these patches consistently.\n\nEase of Use (5/5):\nApplying these patches is a breeze. They adhere well to the skin and stay in place throughout the day or night. The different sizes in the pack make it easy to choose the right one for the pimple\'s size, ensuring a secure fit. Plus, they are transparent, so they blend seamlessly with the skin, making them discreet to wear in public.\n\nQuantity (5/5):\nThis 120-pack is a fantastic value for the price. With so many patches included, I feel like I\'m well-prepared for any unexpected breakouts. It\'s convenient not to have to reorder frequently.\n\nSkin-Friendly (4/5):\nWhile the patches are generally gentle on the skin, I did notice some minor irritation on particularly sensitive areas of my face after extended use. However, this could vary from person to person, and it wasn\'t a widespread issue for me.\n\nOverall, the KEYCONCEPTS Pimple Patches for Face have become a staple in my skincare routine. They effectively tackle pimples, are easy to use, and offer great value for the quantity provided. I would recommend these hydrocolloid patches with tea tree oil to anyone looking for an effective solution to combat blemishes and speed up the healing process.\nRead more\n17 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tDalton O\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Seriously Effective!\nReviewed in the United States on September 30, 2023\nSize: 120 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase\nThese pimple patches are great! My partner and I use pimple patches all the time, as we both have frequent and often problematic breakouts. As such, we\'ve tried dozens of brands and I have to say, these are by far the best. As soon as you open the package, you can smell the tea tree oil on them so you can tell they\'re the real deal. They have three different sizes- ranging from extra large, medium large, and then a small-ish medium. I know those sizes sound weird but if you see them, you\'ll understand. The smallest size is really not all that small. They also aren\'t the most discrete patches I\'ve used as they aren\'t a perfect clear and they discolor fairly quickly during use. That being said, I\'m more than happy to deal with the visibility because they last forever with very strong adhesion and they WORK. They ACTUALLY work! I leave mine on as long as I can and by the time I\'m ready to take them off, my pimples are smaller if not completely drained of sebum. I can\'t recommend them enough!\n2 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tKate O\'Neill\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Pure magic.\nReviewed in the United States on September 30, 2023\nSize: 120 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase\nThese things are bananas. Not sure how they work, but they do. I use tweezers to take them off the sheet so they don\'t stick to themselves (you know what I mean, like a bandaid does sometimes) and they stay on perfectly. If your skin is oily, you may want to wipe it off first with an astringent so the patch stays on better.\n\nI\'m almost 40 and occasionally get a pimple here and there. Put one of these on at the first sight of one and it\'s immediately getting rid of the yuck. Sometimes it takes a few days, sometimes it takes a few hours, but you can visibly see the progress. Teenager in the house and we both swear by these. 100% recommend.\n2 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tMohammed Sahil Akbar\n3.0 out of 5 stars\n Average Pimple Patches - Decent but Not Outstanding\nReviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023\nSize: 120 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase\nI recently tried the KEYCONCEPTS Pimple Patches for Face (120 Pack), and here\'s my honest three-star review:\n\nEffectiveness (3/5): These patches do an okay job when it comes to treating pimples. They help with absorbing the gunk and reducing inflammation, but I found that they were not as effective as some other brands I\'ve used in the past. It often took longer for my pimples to fully heal when using these patches.\n\nPack Size (4/5): The 120-pack is quite generous, and you get a lot of patches for the price. However, if you\'re someone who only occasionally deals with pimples, this might be more than you need. I wish there was an option for a smaller pack size.\n\nAdhesion (3/5): The adhesion of these patches is decent but not exceptional. They stick well initially, but I noticed that they tend to peel off easily if applied on oily skin or areas prone to movement, like around the mouth. Other brands I\'ve tried had better staying power.\n\nNow, let me compare these KEYCONCEPTS Pimple Patches to some other brands I\'ve used:\n\nCosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch (4/5): These patches are slightly more effective in my experience. They seem to work faster in reducing the size and redness of pimples. However, they are a bit thinner and less discreet than KEYCONCEPTS patches.\n\nNexcare Acne Absorbing Covers (3.5/5): Similar in effectiveness to KEYCONCEPTS patches, but they have better adhesion. They stay in place even on oily skin, which is a big plus.\n\nMighty Patch Original (4/5): These patches are very effective and have excellent adhesion. However, they are pricier than KEYCONCEPTS patches.\n\nIn summary, the KEYCONCEPTS Pimple Patches are decent but not outstanding in terms of effectiveness and adhesion. While the pack size is generous, they could be more effective, especially compared to some other options on the market. If you\'re looking for a more budget-friendly option and don\'t mind waiting a bit longer for results, these could be a suitable choice. However, if you want quicker and more reliable results, you might want to consider other brands with a higher rating.\nRead more\n25 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nSee more reviews\nTop reviews from other countries\n\tthe artist\n4.0 out of 5 stars\n Not for use on deep cystic acne\nReviewed in Canada on October 16, 2023\nSize: 120 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase\nIn order for these to work well , the acne must be either near or at the surface.

If you’ve broken the rules (and gone against dermatologists’ advice) by taking matters into your own hands, you may be left with the gory aftermath: An open wound leaking pus, oil and even blood.\n\nEnter pimple patches, sometimes known as zit stickers, which may be able to help soothe your skin in a pinch. Dermatologist Amy Kassouf, MD, explains what these over-the-counter spot treatments can — and can’t — do for your skin troubles.\n\nHow do pimple patches work?\n\nPimple patches are small stickers made with a slightly gummy wound-healing gel called hydrocolloid. Larger versions are marketed as “blister bandages,” but they’re all designed to do the same thing: Help your skin heal faster.\n\n“Pimple patches work by absorbing any drainage from the pimple and covering the wound to prevent further trauma to the site, such as picking,” Dr. Kassouf explains. “They work best on open, draining, healing pustules, papules and cysts.”\n\nOf course, you know you’re not supposed to pick at your skin or pop zits. But if you’ve already committed this skin care sin, a pimple patch may be a helpful healer.\n\nHow to use pimple patches\n\nMost pimple patches need to be worn for a few hours in order to do their thing, so you may want to plan to apply yours before bed. Some versions are also designed to be inconspicuous enough to be worn during the day.\n\nBefore applying your pimple patch, make sure your skin is completely dry, as the patches won’t stick as well to wet skin. If your freshly picked pimple is leaking or oozing, be sure to cleanse the spot before application.\n\nSimply apply the pimple patch over your zit — remember, they only work on open wounds — and leave it on for the recommended amount of time (which varies by product). When you peel it off, your blemish may be smaller and less inflamed.\n\nCan pimple patches make acne worse?\n\nFor most people, pimple patches are, at worst, simply unhelpful — which is to say that they won’t make your acne worse, but they won’t make it better, either. If you have sensitive skin, though, you may want to steer clear of pimple patches.\n\n“They do use a bit of adhesive to stick to your skin, so if you’re allergic or sensitive to adhesive, this may aggravate the skin surrounding the lesion,” Dr. Kassouf says.\n\nAnd some brands use ingredients such as salicylic acid or tea tree oil to dry out pimples, which may also dry or irritate sensitive skin.\n\nWhat pimple patches can’t do\n\nThough pimple patches can be very effective on existing lesions, they have significant limitations.\n\n“Pimple patches don’t work at all on closed lesions or deeper lesions or even blackheads and whiteheads, which are called comedones,” Dr. Kassouf explains. “They are spot treatments for active bumps and have no ability to prevent acne from coming,” nor can they clear clogged pores or other precursors to acne flares.”\n\nIn other words, if you’re struggling with cystic acne, large-scale breakouts or other skin concerns, pimple patches aren’t going to do the trick.\n\nWhat to try instead of pimple patches\n\nThere’s no real harm in using zit stickers — but they may not work, either, leaving you pimply and frustrated. “They’re really just wound healing dressings for a very specific type of lesion,” Dr. Kassouf says. “They can be helpful, but for overall acne treatment, there is little use for them.\xa0\n\nDon’t fret, though. You’ve got options.\n\n“There are a lot of great over-the-counter medications these days that do more for the money,” Dr. Kassouf says.\n\nAdapalene: This vitamin A derivative, available in topical form, can help make skin cells less sticky so they don’t hang around and clog your pores, which can not only help prevent acne but can help heal it, too.\nSalicylic acid: This beta hydroxy acid is available in cleansers and topical applications to help exfoliate and clean your skin, as well as decrease acne inflammation.\xa0\nFoaming cleansers: These face washes are great for removing dirt and pollutants that can increase inflammation and breakouts.\nEmergency treatments: If you have a big event coming up and need to get rid of a major pimple in a hurry, talk to your dermatologist about quick-turnaround options, including cortisone and antibiotic injections.\n\nIf your breakouts are related to an underlying issue like a hormonal imbalance, these treatments may not be enough for you. “If hormones are the issue, your dermatologist may have much better options for you,” Dr. Kassouf says.\n\nBottom line? Pimple patches can be a worthwhile option for certain, minor skin troubles, but don’t expect them to be a cure-all for your skin ailments.\n\nFACEBOOK\nTWITTER\nLINKEDIN\nPINTEREST\nEmail\nacne acne treatment\nADVERTISING POLICY\nRelated Articles\nMarch 15, 2022 / Skin Care & Beauty\nPimple Popping 101: How to (Safely) Zap Your Zits\nOctober 31, 2022 / Skin Care & Beauty\nWhat It Means When Acne Is on Certain Areas of Your Face\xa0\nSeptember 22, 2021 / Skin Care & Beauty\nDo Home Remedies for Cystic Acne Work?\nOctober 29, 2021 / Skin Care & Beauty\nAntibiotics for Acne: How Much Is Too Much?\nFebruary 14, 2020 / Skin Care & Beauty\nHow Microneedling Smooths Your Wrinkles\nDecember 22, 2022 / Skin Care & Beauty\nWhy You Should Never Put Toothpaste on a Pimple\nTrending Topics\n1\nShould You Get the Newest COVID-19 Vaccine?\n2\nWhy Am I Still Tired After a Good Night’s Sleep?\n3\n5 Health Benefits of Iodine\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nPinterest\nSnapchat\nHealth Essentials\nHome\nAbout Cleveland Clinic\nCareers at Cleveland Clinic\nGiving\nOffice of Diversity & Inclusion\nCommunity Outreach\nResearch & Innovations\nHealth Library\nFree Health eNewsletters\nResources for Medical Professionals\nMedia Relations\nSite Information & Policies\nSend Us Feedback\nAbout this Website\nAdvertising Policy\nSocial Media Policy\nCopyright, Reprints & Licensing\nWebsite Terms of Use\nWebsite Privacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNon-Discrimination Notice\nResources\nMobile Apps\nPodcasts\nCleveland Clinic © 1995-2023.

We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.\n\nPeriod, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren\'t blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month.\xa0\n\nLucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I\'ll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.\n\nKeep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.\n\nCOSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH\n\nBEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types\n\nKEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid\n\nPRICE: $19\n\nABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.\n\nAbout My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts\n\nMy skin can be unpredictable. But, as I\'ve gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.\xa0\xa0\n\nIngredients: One key, familiar ingredient\xa0\n\nThe tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.\n\nThe Feel: Like a bandage\n\nYou can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Packaging: Easy to store\n\nThe 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish\n\nI placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.\n\nEven with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn\'t budge overnight.\n\nIf you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn\'t expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn\'t gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don\'t believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Value: Worth it\n\nWas this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nSimilar Products: You\'ve got options\xa0\n\nsquish.

They do their sucking up pus job well and are the cheapest per patch (in where I\'m from). I can even put on wash-off or sheet masks after I put the patches on, and the patches won\'t fall off after the masks! The honey ones are harder to find but slightly better than the normal ones, since the honey ones don\'t dry up the area if you replace the patch multiple times on the same pimple.\n\nVT Cica Spot Patch is slightly pricier than the Olive Young patches but they have more large patches (12mm) than Olive Young. VT patches performs exactly the same as Olive Young for me so I always grab them on Yesstyle if they are on sale.\n\nDr. Wonder patches are less adhesive than Olive Young and VT but they are still nice, you just have to be careful if you want to wash your face while keeping the same patch on. They have larger sizes (12mm and 14mm) for the pink version but I didn\'t try that. What I love and buy the most from their range is the white version, which contains nicotinamide that does help lightening the acne scars! When the pus from the pimples are almost gone from using Olive Young/VT patches, I put on the Dr. Wonder White patches to have less hyperpigmentation!\n\nFor micro-needle patches though I still haven\'t found the best yet :c\n\nReply\nreply\nsakuraa_329\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nPurito has some that I really love, even more than the COSRX ones, which I’ve been using for years.

They work as well as any other brand, but the adhesion is a little less adhesive than others. Not so much that it’s an issue, but they could afford to be a little bit stickier.

There were many issues with the others I\'ve tried: patches didn\'t stay on well, they didn\'t absorb the funky stuff from the acne, they left a mark, and / or were way too obvious. These SAKURA ACNE PATCHES are the opposite of all that- THEY ARE AMAZING! They stay in place until they are filled up with the junk they\'ve absorbed. They stick so well that I can wash my face with it on so I don\'t spread acne germs to other parts of my face. The acne is noticeably improved after wearing the patch for even just a couple (2) hours; the blemish is lighter in color, not as swollen, and not as raised! Once the patch fills up, I remove it and apply another. I repeat the process until the blemish is gone. For me, it takes about 2-3 days from start to finish. I am so thankful to have found these patches. They help clear things up quickly and painlessly, which in turn helps me feel more confident about my skin. I\'ve purchased these patches 3 times now and will continue to do so when I am in need. I highly recommend them! PS- SAKURA, please make some sort of face mask with the qualities and powers of these patches! I can only imagine the wonders it would do for the entire face!\n11 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tLisa\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Do the job\nReviewed in the United States on November 18, 2022\nPattern Name: Acne PatchesVerified Purchase\nI order these across Amazon from quite a few brands, and these hold up just fine.

I like that they’re fairly inconspicuous, especially on my chest/back so I’m not as self conscious.\nAfter a shower, I just clean the area with a cotton swab and alcohol, dry, then apply and leave on until it easily comes off (usually about 24 hours later/after another shower). 9 times out of 10, that’s all it takes and the spot is gone. Ocassionally, I have to reapply again but it’s never taken more than 2 applications.\nHighly recommend, these are now a staple in my house.\nOne person found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tlynisbored\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Definitely would buy again!\nReviewed in the United States on March 18, 2021\nPattern Name: Acne PatchesVerified Purchase\nI was always so skeptical about trends like these. I’ve suffered with acne for decades and damn — these things work. I’m horrible at skin care and I’ll touch pop squeeze everything I’m not supposed to. I should know by now that those methods will just prolong everything but I just can’t help It and want it gone now! Let me tell you these things work. As soon as I feel some type of bump, I’ll put one on and the magic works and it’ll pull everything out and I swear by day two it looks so much better compared to day two without it. The best part is as often as I use these things and for the amount of bumps I get, I still have so many patches left. You definitely get your money’s worth AND then some. I definitely recommend and I’m definitely purchasing more — especially if they’re on the [lightning]deal of the day.\n3 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nPrevious page\nNext page\nQuestions?

So, what to do with these\xa0small, painful, discolored bumps with a thick, white-yellow\xa0fluid (pus) at the tip?\n\nThe Difference Between Acne and Pimples\n\nCommonly known as spots or zits, pimples are a part of acne. The dreaded pimples surface because of hormone production changes during puberty. When hormones become active during puberty, sebaceous glands located at the base of hair follicles may become overstimulated.\xa0 Sebaceous (oil) glands are microscopic glands found in your hair follicles that secrete sebum, an oily substance that protects your skin from drying out. Pimples form when dead skin cells mix with excess oil (sebum). This mixture plugs the pore, causing swelling. Bacteria can grow in the mix and lead to infection and pus. Pimples are most likely to occur during the teenage years and, for women, around menstruation.\n\n\nThe clearest way to distinguish between acne and pimples is to understand that pimples are a symptom of a condition, whereas acne is the condition itself, an inflammatory disorder of the skin. Someone who has acne-prone skin will experience pimples as a part of their condition; however, not everyone who gets the occasional pimple has acne-prone skin.\n\nPimple Patches\n\nWhat do you do about pimples? You’re\xa0told not to pop, squeeze, or pick at the blemish. Popping a pimple delays the natural healing process. It can cause infection and scarring, and it may make the pimple more inflamed and noticeable.\xa0 Fortunately, technology has a solution, and that solution is pimple patches. Pimple patches are also known as acne stickers.\n\nA pimple patch is an adhesive sticker that you apply directly to a pimple and leave on for a stretch of time to reduce the breakout.\xa0\n\nTo use pimple patches, first clean and moisturize your face as normal. Then apply the sticker to your pimple and wear it overnight. You can keep it on while you shower, as it is waterproof, then wash your face as you would during your usual morning routine.\n\nThere are several brands of pimple patches, as well as ingredients used to treat the pimples themselves. A pimple patch is designed for one-time use since the capacity of agents to absorb oils is limited. The actual patch is disposable due to the biodegradable materials used in its production. One film of pimple patches typically consists of up to 15 patches.\n\nPimple patches can help pimples go away overnight. These spot treatments act as a bandage that prevents you\xa0from touching them and absorbs the fluid from the pimples, creating a moist environment for faster and improved healing. The patch won’t stop the next pimple from appearing, but the pimple can be fixed more quickly.\n\nDon\'t pick of squeeze!\nCredit: Shutterstock\n\nHow the Patches Work\n\nChemically, how do the patches actually work? Pimple patches are commonly made of hydrocolloid, a gel-forming material originally used for healing wounds. Hydrocolloids are a heterogenous group of long-chain polymers that can be polysaccharides or proteins. Hydrocolloid just\xa0means a polymeric material that absorbs water to form\xa0a gel. The polymers used as hydrocolloids have a number of hydroxyl (-OH) groups that markedly increase their affinity for binding water.\n\nThis is a typical hydrocolloid called carboxymethylcellulose.\xa0 The orange sections are places where hydrogen bonding can occur\xa0with water molecules. This is especially true for the OH groups and the O-Na+ groups.\nCredit: Lamberti\n\n\nThe application of self-adhesive hydrocolloid dressings is most commonly associated with the treatment of chronic ulcerative conditions where an open wound develops on the skin from injury, poor circulation, or pressure sores. Hydrocolloid dressings may also offer benefits in the care of acute wounds of all types.\n\nFor the small wound on your face, the pimple patches are little dressings. Hydrocolloid dressings consist of a thick, self-adhesive layer of a gellable mass that is applied to a flexible polyurethane film. Hydrocolloid dressings are made up of two layers.\n\nThe inner lining is usually made of hydrocolloids such as carboxymeth-ylcellulose, gelatin or pectin with with many water-binding groups in the chemical structure. The water-attracting material draws out fluid from the wound. The tough, outer layer is usually polyurethane, a thin transparent material that is easy to peel off.\n\nThe outer layer keeps everything in place, as well as preventing the water from evaporating and drying out the wound. The wound heals faster, and the new skin that forms is supple rather than tight and stiff. It also protects the wound from rubbing and scratching on surfaces.\n\nPatches that only contain hydrocolloid are known as nonmedicated patches.\xa0\n\n“As the hydrocolloid gel adheres to the skin, it absorbs excess oil and dirt away from pimples,” said Hadley King, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist. Nonmedicated hydrocolloid patches may be worn for two to three days, as long as you change the patch every day.\n\nThe hydrocolloid dressings are available in many shapes and some also have an additional adhesive border to prevent leakage or sliding of the dressing over the wound. Adhesives are used to attach the patch to the face.\n\nThere are three types of adhesives: Acrylic, silicone, and hydrogel. Silicone or hydrogel make the most quality adhesive. It is important to use a high-quality adhesive, so it stays in one place and does not cause irritation to the skin.\n\nThe Active Ingredients in Patches\n\nSome pimple patches are full of added acne-fighting ingredients, while others are just hydrocolloid gel patches.\xa0\n\n“The patch, or set of ingredients that will work best, depends on your skin type,” said Orit Markowitz, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Opti Skin in New York City.\n\nPimple patches may help decrease inflammation, meaning red swollen bumps that sit near the surface of the skin, or give you no results at all. Therefore, many experts believe that these patches work only on a specific type of pimple.\n\nHere are some of the ingredients in pimple patches and how each may affect your skin:\n\nw Salicylic acid: A beta hydroxy acid and popular acne-fighting ingredient in skin care and shampoo, salicylic acid can help unclog pores and remove excess sebum, or oil. Patches containing salicylic acid could be a good option for a fairly inflamed pimple, but they may irritate dryer, sensitive skin.\n\nTea tree oil or tea tree extract: Similar to salicylic acid, “tea tree oil can be very drying,” said Dr. Markowitz, making it a great tool for drying out pimples, but potentially irritating for sensitive skin. Tea tree oil also kills bacteria and decreases inflammation and redness.\nHyaluronic acid: When spread on pimple patches, this popular skin-care ingredient “helps to hydrate the skin, which helps to prevent drying from salicylic acid,” said King.\nNiacinamide: “Another great addition,” Dr. King said, to a pimple patch because it can “improve skin tone and texture, and it has stabilizing effects on the skin’s barrier function, which can help improve moisture retention.” Niacinamide is a version of vitamin B3 (niacin).\nBenzoyl peroxide: “Benzoyl peroxide is an antiseptic that’s been used to treat acne for decades; however, it is best to avoid it if you have experienced prior irritation to it,” said Marisa Grassick, M.D., a dermatologist at Medical Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery (MDCS) in New York City. Benzoyl peroxide helps reduce breakouts by acting as an antiseptic, killing bacteria in and around the pimple.\nSalicylic acid, Benzoyl Peroxide, and Niacinamide\nTypes of Patches\n\nUse a hydrocolloid bandage if your pimple is raised or has visible pus, so it can drain the fluid and flatten the pimple.\xa0\n\n“These patches are effective because they absorb excess fluid and have a vacuum-like effect that gets out any dirt and oil that could be causing a breakout,” said Debra Jaiman, M.D., a New York City dermatologist and the author of Skin Rules. “It then converts those impurities into a gel-like substance that sticks to the patch and is sealed away from the face.”\n\nIf your pimple is too wet, however, it can keep the bandage from adhering. If your pimple doesn’t have any fluid in it, a hydrocolloid patch won’t do much.\xa0\n\n“Pimple patches that contain ingredients that help treat the breakout, like salicylic acid, might deliver some extra help to clear dirt and bacteria out of pores and speed clearing,” said Dr. Jaiman.\n\nAnother type of pimple patch is the microneedle patch. It has several tiny, fine spikes that help deliver the active ingredients deeper into the skin. The arrangement is relatively more effective due to better delivery of skin-care ingredients. The active ingredients are able to more easily reach the site allowing the skin cells to absorb them.\n\nTypes of Pimple Patches\nHydrocolloid\n(nonmedicated)\n\nCoated with gel-forming agents that help to form moistness around the problem area and draw excess oil and pus out of the pimple.\nUseful for blemishes that have come to a head and are ready to pop.\n\nMedicated\n\nInfused with ingredients that\xa0have mild medical properties.\n\nTargets bacteria and\xa0inflammation.\n\nMicroneedling\n\nEquipped with several tiny, fine spikes that help deliver the active ingredients deeper into the skin.\nIdeal for blind pimples, which are deep bumps that form under the skin. They can be nearly invisible, small, or large, red, and painful.\n\nPopular and Efficient\n\nAccording to Brendan Camp, M.D., a dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology, pimple patches are seeing a rise in popularity for several reasons, such as “the increase in COVID masking, or the result of excess acne-causing bacteria in the area of the face that lies underneath a standard face mask, that is, the nose, cheeks, and chin. In addition, the self-care movement has taken off as more people spend time at home and find ways to better themselves and their skin.”\n\nPimple patches are also convenient, replacing a thick lotion or gel over the pimples for a skin-colored patch and making the breakout less visible. The market for pimple patches was valued at $510 million in 2021, indicating their prevalent use and convenience.\n\nAll things considered, pimple patches are popular and efficient.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\nEnsoul Medical Clinic, Singapore.

But when you only have one or two zits at any given time, there\'s no need to treat your entire face. Enter the pimple patch, a targeted way to zap acne without exposing the rest of your skin to undue drying or irritation. According to board-certified dermatologist Sheilagh Maguiness, MD, acne patches typically contain hydrocolloid gel,1 which is often used in wound care. Hydrocolloid patches are able to keep the spot moist in order to accelerate healing and protect. In addition to healing blemishes, Dr. Maguiness notes, "The hydrocolloid in the acne sticker can help absorb sebum and dirt."\xa0\n\nClaire Wolinsky, MD, a New York dermatologist specializing in facial rejuvenation, says she loves pimple patches and recommends them frequently: "One reason they are particularly helpful in treating acne is because once covered, patients can\'t pick or squeeze their pimple, which reduces the risk of infection and bacteria." And with less trauma to the skin, Dr. Wolinsky says you\'re less likely to experience scarring or discoloration.\n\nWe conducted hours of research on the best acne patches, evaluating each on active ingredients to target acne as well as ingredients to soothe skin and prevent redness. We also looked at things like how easy they are to apply and how well they stay on. After considering dozens of brands and consulting with two celebrity dermatologists, we landed on the following best in show.\n\n\nOur Top Picks\nBEST OVERALL:\nPeace Out Acne Dots at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST BUDGET:\nSoko Glam The Klog at Sokoglam.com\nJump to Review\nBEST DRUGSTORE:\nClearasil Ultra Overnight Spot Patches at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST SPLURGE:\nPeter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST K-BEAUTY:\nCOSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST FOR DEEP PIMPLES:\nZitSticka Killa Kit at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST FOR SCARRING:\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch The Original at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST MULTI-INGREDIENT:\nAvarelle Acne Cover Patch at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST WITH SALICYLIC ACID:\nDime Beauty Co.

"They employ hydrocolloid2 technology that helps extract impurities and guards against external elements," he explains. What\'s more, the patches create a barrier between pimples and your bacteria-laden fingers while delivering a time-released infusion of ingredients.\n\nCosmetic nurse Kristina Kitsos is also a fan of Peace Out. "They contain salicylic acid,3 which penetrates pores to target acne blemishes and blackheads," she tells Byrdie. Additionally, Kitsos appreciates that these acne patches contain soothing aloe vera to minimize redness and skin-clearing standby vitamin A (aka retinol).4 She says that since they\'re formulated with hydrating ingredients, the skin is able to heal quicker and better than if a drying, alcohol formula was used.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nIf you have skin that dries out or breaks easily, this is a great pick because of the inclusion of aloe vera—which can soothe and hydrate. Even pimple patches can sometimes tear the sensitive skin around a blemish, but you won\'t have to worry about that with these.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $19\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid, salicylic acid, aloe, retinol | Amount: 10 to 40 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\nBest BudgetSoko Glam The Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch\n\nSoko Glam\n\nVIEW ON SOKOGLAM.COM\nWhat We Like\n\nBudget-friendly\n\nLong-lasting adhesive\n\nIncludes two sizes\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nThinner patch than other options\n\nWhile most pimple patches aren\'t very pricey, The Klog\'s Soft Shield is one of the budget-friendliest of the bunch. Containing vegan hydrocolloid,2 the protective yet breathable barrier draws out impurities and helps your zits heal as quickly as possible.\xa0We love that these super-thin patches are almost invisible—perfect for wear during the day. They\'re unnoticeable whether you\'re in a virtual meeting or on a walk, and they\'ll keep your skin shielded from bacteria (and your fingers).\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nThese pimple patches can be super helpful for those who find it hard to stop themselves from picking since they are so lightweight they can be worn anytime. They\'re also great for people on a budget or for those looking for a vegan formula patch.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $6\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 42 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\n\nBest DrugstoreClearasil Ultra Overnight Spot Patches\n\nAmazon\n\nVIEW ON AMAZON\nVIEW ON TARGET\nVIEW ON WALMART\nWhat We Like\n\nBudget-friendly\n\nWorks overnight\n\nNon-drying\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nOnly one size\n\nA few drugstore brands have hopped on the pimple-patch bandwagon, but the best iteration comes from acne-fighting all-star Clearasil. Stick on the Spot Patches before bed, get your beauty sleep, and wake up to noticeable improvements in the size and redness of your blemishes. These patches have thinner, smooth edges, so they\'re able to adhere to the skin better without budging.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nIf you\'re a wild sleeper and often wake up to your pimple patch on your pillow, we recommend these.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $14\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 18 patches | Cruelty-Free: No\n\n\nBest SplurgePeter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots\n\nSephora\n\nVIEW ON AMAZON\nVIEW ON ULTA\nVIEW ON WALMART\nWhat We Like\n\nContains skin-clearing and moisturizing ingredients\n\nIncludes two sizes\n\nComes with tin container\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nDoesn\'t contain hydrocolloid\n\nPeter Thomas Roth\'s take on the acne patch is the super-moisturizing Invisible Dots. In addition to acne-clearing mainstays salicylic acid5 and tea tree oil,6 they call on hyaluronic acid7 to deliver much-needed moisture to the bumps that lie beneath. These aren\'t hydrocolloid patches, so they won\'t absorb the gunk out of a pimple that\'s already come to a head.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nWe recommend these patches for big, red pimples that you want to reduce in size quickly.

Serving up a heaping dose of hydrocolloid8 underneath each hygienic sticker, you can target even the most stubborn bumps with little effort. We also like that these Korean patches come in three different sizes.\n\nWhen we tested them for ourselves, we loved that they didn\'t budge while we slept (even when applied over our nighttime serums). The pimple was noticeably smaller in the morning, and the patches kept the blemish from becoming irritated during use.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nThese patches come in three different sizes to best fit whatever type of pimple you have.

These patches are the ones that you\'ll want to try to get those hard-to-reach blemishes. It has a two-step process: swipe the pad (which is infused with tea tree oil and salicylic acid) on clean skin and then apply the patch directly to the blemish. It\'s made with super-fine microneedles so that the ingredients are able to penetrate the skin better, and the patch is also formulated with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and peptides to hydrate and heal the affected area and effectively flatten the pimple.\n\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nIf you\'ve tried everything for hormonal acne and are looking for a targeted, effective treatment without taking a trip to the dermatologist, these are a great pick.

If you have a blemish that you feel the need to conceal during the day, we recommend reaching for these patches from Rael. They have super thin edges that stick onto the skin seamlessly and lay as flat as possible for a hydrocolloid patch. Even though they\'re less noticeable than others on the market, they\'re still just as effective at protecting from bacteria and removing impurities from the spot overnight.\n\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nPicking at your skin is a hard habit to break, but it\'s necessary in order to not make blemishes worse and create a scar. Wearing a pimple patch throughout the day can help, and these patches from Rael will go unnoticed while you\'re out with friends or even at work.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $17\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 96 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\nWhere We Stand\n\nThe best pimple patches overall are Peace Out Acne Healing Dots. They contain hydrocolloid, and also a blend of soothing and clearing ingredients like retinol, salicylic acid, and aloe. For a more affordable option, consider The Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch, a breathable yet protective solution that draws out impurities and speeds up healing.\n\nWhat to Look for When Buying Acne Patches\nHydrocolloid: "The most important thing is that the stickers or patches are made of hydrocolloid," Dr. Wolinsky tells Byrdie, which is "something dermatologists have used for wound care for a long time." The healing ingredient seals the skin underneath the patch while absorbing fluid, flattening bumps, and minimizing inflammation.8Some options, like Peach Slices Acne Spot Dots, are made with nothing more than hydrocolloid, which does an excellent job taking care of pimples on its own.\nActive Ingredients: Most acne patches utilize hydrocolloid, which can be very effective on its own. However, you\'ll also find options containing a range of other acne-fighting ingredients. As Dr. Wolinsky notes, "Some of these patches have salicylic acid, which may help further treat a nasty breakout." Additionally, you might see soothing aloe vera extract,14 resurfacing retinol,4 complexion-clearing tea tree oil,15 or hydrating hyaluronic acid12 on the ingredients list.\nDime Beauty Power Patches are an excellent choice if you\'re looking for something containing salicylic acid, and Peter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots are a great option with tea tree oil. Some patches, like Mario Badescu Drying Patches, contain both.\nSize: Since pimples and breakouts come in all shapes and sizes, it\'s nice to have a couple of different acne patches to work with. While many brands offer only one size, some packs include two or even three sizes to cover large and small zits accordingly. For instance, The Klog\'s Soft Shield Pimple Patches come with two sizes. You\'ll also find extra-large patches, which are meant to cover multi-bump breakouts.\nFAQ\nHow do acne patches work?\n\n"Most acne patches work by providing a moist occluded environment so that the acne lesion can heal underneath," says Dr. Maguiness. They typically contain hydrocolloid,8 which, as Dr. Wolinsky explains, absorbs the inflammatory fluid, flattens the bump, and speeds up healing. "The added bonus is that they keep fingers off and prevent picking," notes Dr. Maguiness.\n\n\nHow do you apply acne patches?\n\nStarting with freshly washed hands and clean, dry skin, carefully peel the patch off the sheet. Then, gently stick it on the pimple in question, aligning the center of the patch with the center of the pimple. Leave it on for 12 to 24 hours or until it turns opaque.\n\n\nHow often should you use acne patches?\n\nGenerally speaking, you can use acne patches as often as needed. Since they target only a very small portion of your skin, you shouldn\'t have to worry about irritating the rest of your face or neck. In some cases, you might need to use two or three consecutive patches to get rid of a particularly stubborn pimple.\n\n\nWhy Trust Byrdie\n\nTheresa Holland is a skincare devotee and commerce writer specializing in beauty, lifestyle, and wellness.

summary: I apologize, but I am unable to access the reference information provided. Therefore, I cannot directly respond to the question about the "gel type acne patch." However, I can provide you with a general summary of gel-type acne patches based on my knowledge.

Gel-type acne patches are a type of skincare product designed to treat acne. These patches are typically made of hydrocolloid material, which creates a moist environment that helps to draw out impurities from the skin. The gel-like consistency of these patches adheres to the skin, creating a barrier that protects the acne from external factors such as dirt and bacteria.

These patches are often transparent or semi-transparent, allowing them to be discreetly worn during the day or overnight. They are usually applied directly onto clean, dry skin and left in place for a certain period of time, typically a few hours or overnight. The gel-type patches are designed to absorb excess oil, reduce inflammation, and promote healing of the acne.

While I cannot provide specific feedback or reactions from social media, forums, or review sites, it is common to find user reviews and discussions about gel-type acne patches on these platforms. Users often share their experiences, opinions, and results after using such products. It is recommended to explore these platforms to gather more insights and feedback from actual users.

summary: I apologize, but I am unable to access the reference information at the moment. However, I can provide you with a general overview of gel-type acne patches.

Gel-type acne patches, also known as hydrocolloid patches, are a popular skincare product used to treat acne. These patches are typically made of a gel-like material that adheres to the skin and creates a protective barrier over the acne blemish.

The main purpose of gel-type acne patches is to absorb excess oil and pus from the pimple, while also protecting it from external irritants. They are designed to be worn overnight or throughout the day, depending on the brand and instructions.

Many users find gel-type acne patches to be effective in reducing the size and redness of pimples. They are often praised for their convenience and ease of use, as they can be discreetly worn under makeup or during daily activities.

However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of gel-type acne patches may vary depending on the individual and the severity of their acne. Some users may experience better results than others.

Overall, gel-type acne patches have gained popularity among skincare enthusiasts and have received positive feedback for their ability to speed up the healing process of acne blemishes.

summary: Acne patches, also known as pimple patches or acne stickers, are adhesive stickers that are applied directly to pimples to reduce breakouts. They are designed to be left on for a period of time, usually overnight, to help heal the pimple. Pimple patches are made of hydrocolloid, a gel-forming material that absorbs excess oil and dirt from the pimple. Hydrocolloid is a type of polymer that has hydroxyl groups, which increase its affinity for binding water. The patches create a moist environment that promotes faster and improved healing of the pimple. 

Pimple patches are typically made for one-time use and are disposable due to the biodegradable materials used in their production. They come in various brands and may contain different ingredients to treat the pimples. Some patches are non-medicated and only contain hydrocolloid, while others may contain additional ingredients such as salicylic acid, tea tree oil, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, or benzoyl peroxide. These ingredients have different effects on the skin, such as unclogging pores, reducing inflammation, killing bacteria, and improving skin tone and texture.

There are different types of pimple patches available, including hydrocolloid patches, medicated patches, and microneedle patches. Hydrocolloid patches are suitable for pimples that have come to a head and are ready to pop, as they help draw out excess oil and pus from the pimple. Medicated patches contain ingredients that have mild medical properties and target bacteria and inflammation. Microneedle patches have tiny spikes that help deliver active ingredients deeper into the skin, making them ideal for blind pimples.

Pimple patches have gained popularity for several reasons, including their convenience, effectiveness in absorbing excess fluid and dirt, and their ability to make breakouts less visible. The market for pimple patches was valued at $510 million in 2021, indicating their prevalent use and convenience.

Overall, pimple patches provide a non-invasive and convenient solution for treating pimples, helping to speed up the healing process and improve the appearance of the skin.
