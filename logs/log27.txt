Great product!

I have been buying mighty patch brand for a few years now and I was hesitant to change to this new TKTK. Comparing the two in price, I had to give them a try and they work great!! So much more for your money then other brands and still great quality!

Half half
Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023
Sometimes the patch is thicker than my *** but sometimes it’s as thin as my ***. The thick one that I got for the past 2 orders wouldn’t stick to my skin and by the time I woke up in the morning, the patch will be on my hair, my bed sheet, my back and nowhere to be found. It’s good for sure but it’s like playing a Russian roulette where the thick patch is the bullet.

Such a great value for so much less. I was obsessed with obsessed with the mighty patches put they get really expensive for not a lot especially when you have a lot of pimples. Personally I get really deep painful pimples that last forever these take them away just leashing the little red mark like the patches do. So impressed with this product and the value. Love it so much and could not recommend this more.

My opinion of a product can be clearly measured by if I order it again. It's that simple.
These patches work and dont break my bank. What else is there?

These are so satisfying to use! I wear them to bed and when you wake up you can see white stuff that it pulls out of your pours. Great price, others are more expensive and work the same. Definitely recommend this brand!!

I’ve tried other patches that are popular and this product works the same for a fraction of the price. I also like that it has variety in sizes which is perfect because not all breakouts are made the same

Not as good as the official brands, but better than others at this price point. Sides come up and don’t stick as well, hard to remove from film, but do the job really well.

I swear by these $13 pimple patches for clearing up my acne overnight — I wish I'd had them as a teenager
Written by Connie Chen; edited by Sally Kaplan Updated May 26, 2022, 1:01 AM GMT+9

Hydrocolloid patches absorb pus from pimples, resulting in noticeably smaller and less inflamed blemishes.
I've tried a couple brands of patches, and Mighty Patch has worked better than any of them.
Years after I first discovered the brand, I still buy them for myself all the time. They're a clear and effective overnight fix for acne-prone skin.

From extraction facials and laser treatments to special face washes and oral antibiotics, I've tried many tactics in my decade-old battle with acne. Some, like acne extractions, work very well over the long term, but are quite expensive. Others have dried out my skin or even resulted in more breakouts. The only solution that really works for short-term relief — and that I wish I had tried way earlier — is the hydrocolloid patch. 

Hydrocolloid patches were originally designed for wounds but it turns out they're also perfect for those painful (both physically and emotionally) breakouts that always erupt the night before a big event like an interview or a date.

How hydrocolloid acne patches work

These patches attract water and absorb fluids such as pus so that by the next day, you can literally see everything they've sucked up from your pimples. COSRX was one ofthe first hydrocolloid patch brands, earning rave reviews from other media sites like Buzzfeed and Refinery29 and a 4.6-star rating from 25,000+ Amazon reviews, but I'm a stronger believer in a newer brand's hydrocolloid product: Hero Cosmetics' Mighty Patch, which has a 4.5-star rating and over 90,000 Amazon reviews.

Mighty Patch review

Mighty Patch's Original hydrocolloid patches come in 36- or 72-count packs, and each one measures 12mm across — smaller than a penny. There are also Invisible versions that are thinner and more difficult to see, as well as Surface patches for large clusters of pimples. They work best on pimples with fluid or pus in them, meaning there's a visible whitehead.

After showering and drying my face, I stick the patches directly on the blemishes that fit this description, then let them work their magic. Sometimes, depending on the pimple, I can see and feel results in as quickly as a few hours. Other times, they take longer to take effect, and I sleep with them overnight.

Hero Cosmetics

The results are somewhat gross, but oddly satisfying: The sticker turns white with the pus it has absorbed.

The difference after applying a sticker is clear, and not only visually. Each time, my pimples dramatically reduced in both size and pain. I'm always amazed at how well they work. Over the last couple of years, I've become very comfortable with slapping them all over my face every night, and even during the daytime when I go to work.

Cons of Mighty Patch

The main drawback of these patches is that they can be noticeable if you wear them (the Original product) in public. As a solution, the company made Invisible patches (find our review here), which are more subtle and harder to notice. 

If you're new to pimple patches, you may also find it difficult to peel them off the sheet without wrinkling or folding them, but Hero Cosmetics tries to combat this with an easy-peel sheet design that tears the entire sheet into thirds.

Unexpected benefits of Mighty Patch

A side benefit of these hydrocolloid patches is that they prevent bored, wandering fingers from touching and picking pimples. Every person who has acne hears over and over again and knows from personal experience that picking leads to irritation and scarring, but it's much easier said than done not to do it. As the patches work to minimize your blemish, they also protect the affected area from exposure to unclean pillows and hands. 

Mighty Patch versus COSRX and other competitors 

I also bought myself the COSRX patches to compare their performance, and considering their high reviews and cult status, I was surprised to find they were much less effective than Mighty Patch. The COSRX hydrocolloid patches come in multiple sizes, and they're cheaper than Mighty Patch. However, they were prone to falling off my face as I slept, and rarely absorbed as much fluid as the Mighty Patch stickers. 

In addition to COSRX, I've tried many other patches like the cute (but ultimately ineffective) Starface Hydro-Stars and No B.S. Healing Acne Patches, but again and again, they didn't stack up to Mighty Patch.

While Mighty Patch may be more expensive, I'd much rather opt for the product that actually works. The company originally sent me free samples for review back in April 2018, but since then, I've regularly bought them myself and they've become an integral part of my skin-care kit.

The bottom line

Having dealt with acne since I was a teen, I regret not trying these gentle, non-invasive, and non-drying hydrocolloid patches earlier, but I'm now a serious proponent of using them for banishing acne. They're easy to slip into your bag to take on the go, and as simple stickers, they're low maintenance. 

I'm stocking up on the ones from Mighty Patch in particular because they've shown time after time that they're the best on the market.

Hydrocolloid stickers supercharged with acne-fighting ingredients like salicylic acid can help shrink the appearance of blemishes.

What is that stuff everyone’s sticking on their skin these days? They look like stickers — because they are stickers. More specifically, they’re acne stickers that are also known as acne or pimple patches.

Basically, these are an old-school wound dressing. “Acne patches are made from hydrocolloid material. Hydrocolloid consists of gelatin or pectin,” says Debra Jaliman, MD, a New York City–based dermatologist and the author of Skin Rules. They may be made only of hydrocolloid or they might also be medicated with a common pimple-fighting ingredient like salicylic acid, she adds.

How Can Pimple Patches Help Get Rid of Acne?

Think of these stickers as the ultimate spot treatments. They can help minimize the appearance of pimples while accelerating healing. Here’s how.

They “Suck” the Gunk Out of Your Pores

If you were a fan of pore strips way back when, you’ll love these. “These patches are effective because they absorb excess fluid and have a vacuum-like effect that gets out any dirt and oil that could be causing a breakout,” says Dr. Jaliman. “It then converts those impurities into a gel-like substance that sticks to the patch and is sealed away from the face.” Another perk: They may also prevent bacteria from entering the pimple and exacerbating redness and inflammation. This “sucking” effect is central to hydrocolloid technology, according to the bandage brand Nexcare.

They Can Help Prevent Touching and Picking

If you have a pimple, the one thing a dermatologist will tell you to do is enact a hands-off policy. And what is the one thing you’re guaranteed to do anyway? Pick it or pop it. (There’s a reason Dr. Pimple Popper videos are so popular on YouTube.) “What acne patches probably do the best job at is keeping the area covered so that you can’t pick at your blemish,” says Lauren Fine, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Chicago Cosmetic Surgery and Dermatology. Picking “99 percent of the time will make it worse because it triggers more inflammation, which increases healing time and makes it more likely to leave a mark, discoloration, or scar,” she says. It also drives the pus deeper into the skin, making it more likely to stick around.

They May Help Treat Your Blemish With Actives

Pimple patches that contain ingredients that help treat the breakout, like salicylic acid, might deliver some extra help to clear dirt and bacteria out of pores and speed clearing, says Jaliman. Indeed, the American Academy of Dermatology notes that salicylic acid, in addition to benzoyl peroxide, is one of the best ingredients to treat acne breakouts. It’s like giving a pimple a one-two punch. Some products also include skin-soothing ingredients such as aloe vera and vitamin A, which can help further reduce inflammation, research has shown.

Which Types of Acne Are Pimple Patches Effective For?

These are meant as spot treatments only and are ideally used on whiteheads, which are caused by clogged pores, and maybe cysts that have come to a head, according to Hero Cosmetics, which manufactures hydrocolloid acne patches. However, some brands can be used on red, painful pimples for which the pus has not yet come to the surface. Pimple patches are unlikely to work for blackheads, according to Hero Cosmetics.

If your breakouts look more like a multitude of small red bumps that have spread over a wide area of your face or you have cystic acne, you’re better off seeing your dermatologist, who can put you on a topical regimen that will treat your face as a whole and stop the cycle of acne (rather than continually playing defense to heal pimples as they pop up.)

How to Use a Pimple Patch to Help Shrink Blemishes

Above all, follow the directions on the brand you’re using. Beyond that, Jaliman says that they’re best saved as an overnight treatment. “At night while we sleep, skin cells regenerate,” she says. Meaning: Skin is repairing and rejuvenating, and treating your skin at night can tap into that natural process, improving your results.

Wearing them at night also allows you to leave them on for a long time. To use pimple patches, first clean and moisturize your face as normal. Then apply the sticker to your pimple and wear it overnight. You can keep it on for your shower, as they’re waterproof. Then wash your face as you would during your normal morning routine.

Another note, these are clear — and some people swear that no one can tell when you have them on. According to Hero Cosmetics, you can also wear them during the day (bonus: no urge to touch your blemish) and apply makeup on top.

5 Pimple Patch Options to Consider Trying

Because of the patches’ rise in popularity, you have a host of great options to give a go:

Best Budget Pimple Patch

This unmedicated hydrocolloid patch (meaning it does not contain active ingredients like salicylic acid) is clear so people will hardly know you’re wearing one.

Try Clearasil Rapid Rescue Healing Spot Patches, $9.79, Target.com

Best Multisize Pimple Patch

This pack comes with 24 unmedicated patches in three sizes, ranging from 7 millimeters (mm) to 12 mm, so you can pick the one best suited for your pimple size.

Try Coxrx Acne Pimple Master Patch, $6, Ulta.com

Best Medicated Pimple Patch

Dubbed “healing dots,” these hydrocolloid patches deliver vitamin A (the active ingredient in retinoids that exfoliates and cleans out pores), salicylic acid (a beta hydroxy acid that dissolves pore-clogging debris), and skin-calming aloe vera.

Try Peace Out Acne Healing Dots, $19, Sephora.com

Best Subscription Pimple Patch

Each box of the hydrocolloid patches comes in a count of 36 or 72 — and you can use the "subscribe and save" function to get a 20 percent discount and regular shipments, which take place every 30 to 60 days. The best part: You’ll feel at ease knowing you won’t run out again.

Best Pimple Patch Kit for Emerging Pimples

This two-step kit comes with a swab that’s medicated with blemish-banishers salicylic acid and tea tree oil for cleaning the area. Next, apply a Killa patch, which is outfitted with microdarts, a technology that pushes salicylic acid and anti-inflammatory niacinamide into the zit for quick healing. Most other hydrocolloid patches should be used for pimples that have a white head, but this one is different. The company says it works best on pimples that are red and painful and have not yet come to the surface.

Hydrocolloid stickers supercharged with acne-fighting ingredients like salicylic acid can help shrink the appearance of blemishes.
Shutterstock

What is that stuff everyone’s sticking on their skin these days? They look like stickers — because they are stickers. More specifically, they’re acne stickers that are also known as acne or pimple patches.

Basically, these are an old-school wound dressing. “Acne patches are made from hydrocolloid material. Hydrocolloid consists of gelatin or pectin,” says Debra Jaliman, MD, a New York City–based dermatologist and the author of Skin Rules. They may be made only of hydrocolloid or they might also be medicated with a common pimple-fighting ingredient like salicylic acid, she adds.

How Can Pimple Patches Help Get Rid of Acne?

Think of these stickers as the ultimate spot treatments. They can help minimize the appearance of pimples while accelerating healing. Here’s how.

They “Suck” the Gunk Out of Your Pores

If you were a fan of pore strips way back when, you’ll love these. “These patches are effective because they absorb excess fluid and have a vacuum-like effect that gets out any dirt and oil that could be causing a breakout,” says Dr. Jaliman. “It then converts those impurities into a gel-like substance that sticks to the patch and is sealed away from the face.” Another perk: They may also prevent bacteria from entering the pimple and exacerbating redness and inflammation. This “sucking” effect is central to hydrocolloid technology, according to the bandage brand Nexcare.

They Can Help Prevent Touching and Picking

If you have a pimple, the one thing a dermatologist will tell you to do is enact a hands-off policy. And what is the one thing you’re guaranteed to do anyway? Pick it or pop it. (There’s a reason Dr. Pimple Popper videos are so popular on YouTube.) “What acne patches probably do the best job at is keeping the area covered so that you can’t pick at your blemish,” says Lauren Fine, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Chicago Cosmetic Surgery and Dermatology. Picking “99 percent of the time will make it worse because it triggers more inflammation, which increases healing time and makes it more likely to leave a mark, discoloration, or scar,” she says. It also drives the pus deeper into the skin, making it more likely to stick around.

They May Help Treat Your Blemish With Actives

Pimple patches that contain ingredients that help treat the breakout, like salicylic acid, might deliver some extra help to clear dirt and bacteria out of pores and speed clearing, says Jaliman. Indeed, the American Academy of Dermatology notes that salicylic acid, in addition to benzoyl peroxide, is one of the best ingredients to treat acne breakouts. It’s like giving a pimple a one-two punch. Some products also include skin-soothing ingredients such as aloe vera and vitamin A, which can help further reduce inflammation, research has shown.

Which Types of Acne Are Pimple Patches Effective For?

These are meant as spot treatments only and are ideally used on whiteheads, which are caused by clogged pores, and maybe cysts that have come to a head, according to Hero Cosmetics, which manufactures hydrocolloid acne patches. However, some brands can be used on red, painful pimples for which the pus has not yet come to the surface. Pimple patches are unlikely to work for blackheads, according to Hero Cosmetics.

If your breakouts look more like a multitude of small red bumps that have spread over a wide area of your face or you have cystic acne, you’re better off seeing your dermatologist, who can put you on a topical regimen that will treat your face as a whole and stop the cycle of acne (rather than continually playing defense to heal pimples as they pop up.)

How to Use a Pimple Patch to Help Shrink Blemishes

Above all, follow the directions on the brand you’re using. Beyond that, Jaliman says that they’re best saved as an overnight treatment. “At night while we sleep, skin cells regenerate,” she says. Meaning: Skin is repairing and rejuvenating, and treating your skin at night can tap into that natural process, improving your results.

Wearing them at night also allows you to leave them on for a long time. To use pimple patches, first clean and moisturize your face as normal. Then apply the sticker to your pimple and wear it overnight. You can keep it on for your shower, as they’re waterproof. Then wash your face as you would during your normal morning routine.

Another note, these are clear — and some people swear that no one can tell when you have them on. According to Hero Cosmetics, you can also wear them during the day (bonus: no urge to touch your blemish) and apply makeup on top.

5 Pimple Patch Options to Consider Trying

Because of the patches’ rise in popularity, you have a host of great options to give a go:

Best Budget Pimple Patch

This unmedicated hydrocolloid patch (meaning it does not contain active ingredients like salicylic acid) is clear so people will hardly know you’re wearing one.

Try Clearasil Rapid Rescue Healing Spot Patches, $9.79, Target.com

Best Multisize Pimple Patch

This pack comes with 24 unmedicated patches in three sizes, ranging from 7 millimeters (mm) to 12 mm, so you can pick the one best suited for your pimple size.

Try Coxrx Acne Pimple Master Patch, $6, Ulta.com

Best Medicated Pimple Patch

Dubbed “healing dots,” these hydrocolloid patches deliver vitamin A (the active ingredient in retinoids that exfoliates and cleans out pores), salicylic acid (a beta hydroxy acid that dissolves pore-clogging debris), and skin-calming aloe vera.

Try Peace Out Acne Healing Dots, $19, Sephora.com

RELATED: What Your Blemishes Tell You About Your Acne

Best Subscription Pimple Patch

Each box of the hydrocolloid patches comes in a count of 36 or 72 — and you can use the "subscribe and save" function to get a 20 percent discount and regular shipments, which take place every 30 to 60 days. The best part: You’ll feel at ease knowing you won’t run out again.

Try Mighty Patch Original, $12.99 (pack of 36), HeroCosmetics.us

Best Pimple Patch Kit for Emerging Pimples

This two-step kit comes with a swab that’s medicated with blemish-banishers salicylic acid and tea tree oil for cleaning the area. Next, apply a Killa patch, which is outfitted with microdarts, a technology that pushes salicylic acid and anti-inflammatory niacinamide into the zit for quick healing. Most other hydrocolloid patches should be used for pimples that have a white head, but this one is different. The company says it works best on pimples that are red and painful and have not yet come to the surface.

Try Zitsticka Killa Kit, $29, Zitsticka.com

A Final Word on Using Pimple Patches to Clear Up Your Skin

Acne stickers can be an effective way to deliver medication that treats breakouts, prevent picking, and speeds healing time. They work best for individual pimples and are best worn overnight. As for finally seeing clear skin? Just stick with ’em.

Think of these stickers as the ultimate spot treatments. They can help minimize the appearance of pimples while accelerating healing. Here’s how.

They “Suck” the Gunk Out of Your Pores

If you were a fan of pore strips way back when, you’ll love these. “These patches are effective because they absorb excess fluid and have a vacuum-like effect that gets out any dirt and oil that could be causing a breakout,” says Dr. Jaliman. “It then converts those impurities into a gel-like substance that sticks to the patch and is sealed away from the face.” Another perk: They may also prevent bacteria from entering the pimple and exacerbating redness and inflammation. This “sucking” effect is central to hydrocolloid technology, according to the bandage brand Nexcare.

They Can Help Prevent Touching and Picking

If you have a pimple, the one thing a dermatologist will tell you to do is enact a hands-off policy. And what is the one thing you’re guaranteed to do anyway? Pick it or pop it. (There’s a reason Dr. Pimple Popper videos are so popular on YouTube.) “What acne patches probably do the best job at is keeping the area covered so that you can’t pick at your blemish,” says Lauren Fine, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Chicago Cosmetic Surgery and Dermatology. Picking “99 percent of the time will make it worse because it triggers more inflammation, which increases healing time and makes it more likely to leave a mark, discoloration, or scar,” she says. It also drives the pus deeper into the skin, making it more likely to stick around.

They May Help Treat Your Blemish With Actives

Pimple patches that contain ingredients that help treat the breakout, like salicylic acid, might deliver some extra help to clear dirt and bacteria out of pores and speed clearing, says Jaliman. Indeed, the American Academy of Dermatology notes that salicylic acid, in addition to benzoyl peroxide, is one of the best ingredients to treat acne breakouts. It’s like giving a pimple a one-two punch. Some products also include skin-soothing ingredients such as aloe vera and vitamin A, which can help further reduce inflammation, research has shown.

Which Types of Acne Are Pimple Patches Effective For?

These are meant as spot treatments only and are ideally used on whiteheads, which are caused by clogged pores, and maybe cysts that have come to a head, according to Hero Cosmetics, which manufactures hydrocolloid acne patches. However, some brands can be used on red, painful pimples for which the pus has not yet come to the surface. Pimple patches are unlikely to work for blackheads, according to Hero Cosmetics.

If your breakouts look more like a multitude of small red bumps that have spread over a wide area of your face or you have cystic acne, you’re better off seeing your dermatologist, who can put you on a topical regimen that will treat your face as a whole and stop the cycle of acne (rather than continually playing defense to heal pimples as they pop up.)

How to Use a Pimple Patch to Help Shrink Blemishes

Above all, follow the directions on the brand you’re using. Beyond that, Jaliman says that they’re best saved as an overnight treatment. “At night while we sleep, skin cells regenerate,” she says. Meaning: Skin is repairing and rejuvenating, and treating your skin at night can tap into that natural process, improving your results.

Wearing them at night also allows you to leave them on for a long time. To use pimple patches, first clean and moisturize your face as normal. Then apply the sticker to your pimple and wear it overnight. You can keep it on for your shower, as they’re waterproof. Then wash your face as you would during your normal morning routine.

Another note, these are clear — and some people swear that no one can tell when you have them on. According to Hero Cosmetics, you can also wear them during the day (bonus: no urge to touch your blemish) and apply makeup on top.

5 Pimple Patch Options to Consider Trying

Because of the patches’ rise in popularity, you have a host of great options to give a go:

Best Budget Pimple Patch

This unmedicated hydrocolloid patch (meaning it does not contain active ingredients like salicylic acid) is clear so people will hardly know you’re wearing one.

Try Clearasil Rapid Rescue Healing Spot Patches, $9.79, Target.com

Best Multisize Pimple Patch

This pack comes with 24 unmedicated patches in three sizes, ranging from 7 millimeters (mm) to 12 mm, so you can pick the one best suited for your pimple size.

Try Coxrx Acne Pimple Master Patch, $6, Ulta.com

Best Medicated Pimple Patch

Dubbed “healing dots,” these hydrocolloid patches deliver vitamin A (the active ingredient in retinoids that exfoliates and cleans out pores), salicylic acid (a beta hydroxy acid that dissolves pore-clogging debris), and skin-calming aloe vera.

Best Subscription Pimple Patch

Each box of the hydrocolloid patches comes in a count of 36 or 72 — and you can use the "subscribe and save" function to get a 20 percent discount and regular shipments, which take place every 30 to 60 days. The best part: You’ll feel at ease knowing you won’t run out again.

Try Mighty Patch Original, $12.99 (pack of 36), HeroCosmetics.us

Best Pimple Patch Kit for Emerging Pimples

This two-step kit comes with a swab that’s medicated with blemish-banishers salicylic acid and tea tree oil for cleaning the area. Next, apply a Killa patch, which is outfitted with microdarts, a technology that pushes salicylic acid and anti-inflammatory niacinamide into the zit for quick healing. Most other hydrocolloid patches should be used for pimples that have a white head, but this one is different. The company says it works best on pimples that are red and painful and have not yet come to the surface.

Learn more\n\nHydrocolloid patches absorb pus from pimples, resulting in noticeably smaller and less inflamed blemishes.\nI\'ve tried a couple brands of patches, and Mighty Patch has worked better than any of them.\nYears after I first discovered the brand, I still buy them for myself all the time. They\'re a clear and effective overnight fix for acne-prone skin.\xa0\nAdvertisement\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Original (36-count)\nShop at Amazon \nShop at Ulta Beauty \nShop at Walmart \n\nFrom extraction facials and laser treatments to special face washes and oral antibiotics, I\'ve tried many tactics in my decade-old battle with acne. Some, like acne extractions, work very well over the long term, but are quite expensive. Others have dried out my skin or even resulted in more breakouts. The only solution that really works for short-term relief — and that I wish I had tried way earlier — is the hydrocolloid patch.\xa0\n\nHydrocolloid patches were originally designed for wounds but it turns out they\'re also perfect for those painful (both physically and emotionally) breakouts that always erupt the night before a big event like an interview or a date.\xa0\n\nAdvertisement\nHow hydrocolloid acne patches work\n\nThese patches attract water and absorb fluids such as pus so that by the next day, you can literally see everything they\'ve sucked up from your pimples. COSRX was one ofthe first hydrocolloid patch brands, earning rave reviews from other media sites like Buzzfeed and Refinery29 and a 4.6-star rating from 25,000+ Amazon reviews, but I\'m a stronger believer in a newer brand\'s hydrocolloid product: Hero Cosmetics\' Mighty Patch, which has a 4.5-star rating and over 90,000 Amazon reviews.\xa0\n\nHero Cosmetics/Facebook\nAdvertisement\nMighty Patch review\n\nMighty Patch\'s Original hydrocolloid patches come in 36- or 72-count packs, and each one measures 12mm across — smaller than a penny. There are also Invisible versions that are thinner and more difficult to see, as well as Surface patches for large clusters of pimples. They work best on pimples with fluid or pus in them, meaning there\'s a visible whitehead.\n\nAfter showering and drying my face, I stick the patches directly on the blemishes that fit this description, then let them work their magic. Sometimes, depending on the pimple, I can see and feel results in as quickly as a few hours. Other times, they take longer to take effect, and I sleep with them overnight.\n\nHero Cosmetics\n\nThe results are somewhat gross, but oddly satisfying: The sticker turns white with the pus it has absorbed.\n\nThe difference after applying a sticker is clear, and not only visually. Each time, my pimples dramatically reduced in both size and pain. I\'m always amazed at how well they work. Over the last couple of years, I\'ve become very comfortable with slapping them all over my face every night, and even during the daytime when I go to work.\xa0\n\nAdvertisement\nCons of Mighty Patch\n\nThe main drawback of these patches is that they can be noticeable if you wear them (the Original product) in public. As a solution, the company made Invisible patches (find our review here), which are more subtle and harder to notice.\xa0\n\nIf you\'re new to pimple patches, you may also find it difficult to peel them off the sheet without wrinkling or folding them, but Hero Cosmetics tries to combat this with an easy-peel sheet design that tears the entire sheet into thirds.\xa0\n\nAdvertisement\nUnexpected benefits of Mighty Patch\n\nA side benefit of these hydrocolloid patches is that they prevent bored, wandering fingers from touching and picking pimples. Every person who has acne hears over and over again and knows from personal experience that picking leads to irritation and scarring, but it\'s much easier said than done not to do it. As the patches work to minimize your blemish, they also protect the affected area from exposure to unclean pillows and hands.\xa0\n\nMighty Patch versus COSRX and other competitors\xa0\n\nI also bought myself the COSRX patches to compare their performance, and considering their high reviews and cult status, I was surprised to find they were much less effective than Mighty Patch. The COSRX hydrocolloid patches come in multiple sizes, and they\'re cheaper than Mighty Patch. However, they were prone to falling off my face as I slept, and rarely absorbed as much fluid as the Mighty Patch stickers.\xa0\n\nIn addition to COSRX, I\'ve tried many other patches like the cute (but ultimately ineffective) Starface Hydro-Stars and No B.S. Healing Acne Patches, but again and again, they didn\'t stack up to Mighty Patch.\n\nWhile Mighty Patch may be more expensive, I\'d much rather opt for the product that actually works. The company originally sent me free samples for review back in April 2018, but since then, I\'ve regularly bought them myself and they\'ve become an integral part of my skin-care kit.\xa0\n\nAdvertisement\nThe bottom line\n\nHaving dealt with acne since I was a teen, I regret not trying these gentle, non-invasive, and non-drying hydrocolloid patches earlier, but I\'m now a serious proponent of using them for banishing acne. They\'re easy to slip into your bag to take on the go, and as simple stickers, they\'re low maintenance.\xa0\n\nI\'m stocking up on the ones from Mighty Patch\xa0in particular because they\'ve shown time after time that they\'re the best on the market.\xa0\n\nShop at Amazon\nShop at Ulta Beauty\nShop at Walmart\nConnie Chen\nConnie Chen is a former senior reporter on the Insider Reviews team, where she led coverage of home textiles, home entertaining, and food and drink.

They look like stickers — because they are stickers. More specifically, they’re acne stickers that are also known as acne or pimple patches.\n\nBasically, these are an old-school wound dressing. “Acne patches are made from hydrocolloid material. Hydrocolloid consists of gelatin or pectin,” says\xa0Debra Jaliman,\xa0MD, a New York City–based\xa0dermatologist and the author of\xa0Skin Rules.\xa0They may be made only of hydrocolloid or they might also be medicated with a common pimple-fighting ingredient like salicylic acid, she adds.\n\nHow Can Pimple Patches Help Get Rid of Acne?\n\nThink of these stickers as the ultimate spot treatments. They can help minimize the appearance of pimples while accelerating healing. Here’s how.\n\nThey “Suck” the Gunk Out of Your Pores\n\nIf you were a fan of pore strips way back when, you’ll love these. “These patches are effective because they absorb excess fluid and have a vacuum-like effect that gets out any dirt and oil that could be causing a breakout,” says Dr. Jaliman. “It then converts those impurities into a gel-like substance that sticks to the patch and is sealed away from the face.” Another perk: They may also prevent bacteria from entering the pimple and exacerbating redness and inflammation. This “sucking” effect is central to hydrocolloid technology, according to the bandage brand Nexcare.\n\nRELATED: 10 Surprising Causes of Adult Acne (and How to Get Rid of It)\n\nThey Can Help Prevent Touching and Picking\n\nIf you have a pimple, the one thing a dermatologist will tell you to do is enact a hands-off policy. And what is the one thing you’re guaranteed to do anyway? Pick it or pop it. (There’s a reason Dr. Pimple Popper videos are so popular on YouTube.) “What acne patches probably do the best job at is keeping the area covered so that you can’t pick at your blemish,” says Lauren Fine, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Chicago Cosmetic Surgery and Dermatology. Picking “99 percent of the time will make it worse because it triggers more inflammation, which increases healing time and makes it more likely to leave a mark, discoloration, or scar,” she says. It also drives the pus deeper into the skin, making it more likely to stick around.\n\nThey May Help Treat Your Blemish With Actives\n\nPimple patches that contain ingredients that help treat the breakout, like salicylic acid, might deliver some extra help to clear dirt and bacteria out of pores and speed clearing, says Jaliman. Indeed, the American Academy of Dermatology notes that salicylic acid, in addition to benzoyl peroxide, is one of the best ingredients to treat acne breakouts. It’s like giving a pimple a one-two punch. Some products also include skin-soothing ingredients such as aloe vera and vitamin A, which can help further reduce inflammation, research\xa0has shown.\n\nRELATED: 8 Diet Dos and Don’ts for Preventing Acne\n\n13 Natural Dry-Skin Remedies You Can DIY at Home\nThese natural skin treatments can be done at home with common pantry staples!\n2:22\n0 seconds of 2 minutes, 22 secondsVolume 0%\n\xa0\nWhich Types of Acne Are Pimple Patches Effective For?\n\nThese are meant as spot treatments only and are ideally used on whiteheads, which are caused by clogged pores, and maybe cysts that have come to a head, according to Hero Cosmetics, which manufactures hydrocolloid acne patches. However, some brands can be used on red, painful pimples for which the pus has not yet come to the surface. Pimple patches are unlikely to work for blackheads, according to Hero Cosmetics.\n\nIf your breakouts look more like a multitude of small red bumps that have spread over a wide area of your face or you have cystic acne, you’re better off seeing your dermatologist, who can put you on a topical regimen that will treat your face as a whole and stop the cycle of acne (rather than continually playing defense to heal pimples as they pop up.)\n\nHow to Use a Pimple Patch to Help Shrink Blemishes\n\nAbove all, follow the directions on the brand you’re using. Beyond that, Jaliman says that they’re best saved as an overnight treatment. “At night while we sleep, skin cells regenerate,” she says. Meaning: Skin is repairing and rejuvenating, and treating your skin at night can tap into that natural process, improving your results.\n\nWearing them at night also allows you to leave them on for a long time. To use pimple patches, first clean and moisturize your face as normal. Then apply the sticker to your pimple and wear it overnight. You can keep it on for your shower, as they’re waterproof. Then wash your face as you would during your normal morning routine.\n\nAnother note, these are clear — and some people swear that no one can tell when you have them on. According to Hero Cosmetics, you can also wear them during the day (bonus: no urge to touch your blemish) and apply makeup on top.\n\nRELATED: 10 Things Your Skin Is Trying to Tell You — and How to Respond\n\n5 Pimple Patch Options to Consider Trying\n\nBecause of the patches’ rise in popularity, you have a host of great options to give a go:\n\nBest Budget Pimple Patch\n\nThis unmedicated hydrocolloid patch (meaning it does not contain active ingredients like salicylic acid) is clear so people will hardly know you’re wearing one.\n\nTry Clearasil Rapid Rescue Healing Spot Patches, $9.79, Target.com\n\nBest Multisize Pimple Patch\n\nThis pack comes with 24 unmedicated patches in three sizes, ranging from 7 millimeters (mm) to 12 mm, so you can pick the one best suited for your pimple size.\n\nTry Coxrx Acne Pimple Master Patch, $6, Ulta.com\n\nBest Medicated Pimple Patch\n\nDubbed “healing dots,” these hydrocolloid patches deliver vitamin A (the active ingredient in retinoids that exfoliates and cleans out pores), salicylic acid (a beta hydroxy acid that dissolves pore-clogging debris), and skin-calming aloe vera.\n\nTry Peace Out Acne Healing Dots, $19, Sephora.com\n\nRELATED: What Your Blemishes Tell You About Your Acne\n\nBest Subscription Pimple Patch\n\nEach box of the hydrocolloid patches comes in a count of 36 or 72 — and you can use the "subscribe and save" function to get a 20 percent discount and regular shipments, which take place every 30 to 60 days.

They look like stickers — because they are stickers. More specifically, they’re acne stickers that are also known as acne or pimple patches.\n\nBasically, these are an old-school wound dressing. “Acne patches are made from hydrocolloid material. Hydrocolloid consists of gelatin or pectin,” says\xa0Debra Jaliman,\xa0MD, a New York City–based\xa0dermatologist and the author of\xa0Skin Rules.\xa0They may be made only of hydrocolloid or they might also be medicated with a common pimple-fighting ingredient like salicylic acid, she adds.\n\nHow Can Pimple Patches Help Get Rid of Acne?\n\nThink of these stickers as the ultimate spot treatments. They can help minimize the appearance of pimples while accelerating healing. Here’s how.\n\nThey “Suck” the Gunk Out of Your Pores\n\nIf you were a fan of pore strips way back when, you’ll love these. “These patches are effective because they absorb excess fluid and have a vacuum-like effect that gets out any dirt and oil that could be causing a breakout,” says Dr. Jaliman. “It then converts those impurities into a gel-like substance that sticks to the patch and is sealed away from the face.” Another perk: They may also prevent bacteria from entering the pimple and exacerbating redness and inflammation. This “sucking” effect is central to hydrocolloid technology, according to the bandage brand Nexcare.\n\nRELATED: 10 Surprising Causes of Adult Acne (and How to Get Rid of It)\n\nThey Can Help Prevent Touching and Picking\n\nIf you have a pimple, the one thing a dermatologist will tell you to do is enact a hands-off policy. And what is the one thing you’re guaranteed to do anyway? Pick it or pop it. (There’s a reason Dr. Pimple Popper videos are so popular on YouTube.) “What acne patches probably do the best job at is keeping the area covered so that you can’t pick at your blemish,” says Lauren Fine, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Chicago Cosmetic Surgery and Dermatology. Picking “99 percent of the time will make it worse because it triggers more inflammation, which increases healing time and makes it more likely to leave a mark, discoloration, or scar,” she says. It also drives the pus deeper into the skin, making it more likely to stick around.\n\nThey May Help Treat Your Blemish With Actives\n\nPimple patches that contain ingredients that help treat the breakout, like salicylic acid, might deliver some extra help to clear dirt and bacteria out of pores and speed clearing, says Jaliman. Indeed, the American Academy of Dermatology notes that salicylic acid, in addition to benzoyl peroxide, is one of the best ingredients to treat acne breakouts. It’s like giving a pimple a one-two punch. Some products also include skin-soothing ingredients such as aloe vera and vitamin A, which can help further reduce inflammation, research\xa0has shown.\n\nRELATED: 8 Diet Dos and Don’ts for Preventing Acne\n\n13 Natural Dry-Skin Remedies You Can DIY at Home\nThese natural skin treatments can be done at home with common pantry staples!\n2:22\n0 seconds of 2 minutes, 22 secondsVolume 0%\n\xa0\nWhich Types of Acne Are Pimple Patches Effective For?\n\nThese are meant as spot treatments only and are ideally used on whiteheads, which are caused by clogged pores, and maybe cysts that have come to a head, according to Hero Cosmetics, which manufactures hydrocolloid acne patches. However, some brands can be used on red, painful pimples for which the pus has not yet come to the surface. Pimple patches are unlikely to work for blackheads, according to Hero Cosmetics.\n\nIf your breakouts look more like a multitude of small red bumps that have spread over a wide area of your face or you have cystic acne, you’re better off seeing your dermatologist, who can put you on a topical regimen that will treat your face as a whole and stop the cycle of acne (rather than continually playing defense to heal pimples as they pop up.)\n\nHow to Use a Pimple Patch to Help Shrink Blemishes\n\nAbove all, follow the directions on the brand you’re using. Beyond that, Jaliman says that they’re best saved as an overnight treatment. “At night while we sleep, skin cells regenerate,” she says. Meaning: Skin is repairing and rejuvenating, and treating your skin at night can tap into that natural process, improving your results.\n\nWearing them at night also allows you to leave them on for a long time. To use pimple patches, first clean and moisturize your face as normal. Then apply the sticker to your pimple and wear it overnight. You can keep it on for your shower, as they’re waterproof. Then wash your face as you would during your normal morning routine.\n\nAnother note, these are clear — and some people swear that no one can tell when you have them on. According to Hero Cosmetics, you can also wear them during the day (bonus: no urge to touch your blemish) and apply makeup on top.\n\nRELATED: 10 Things Your Skin Is Trying to Tell You — and How to Respond\n\n5 Pimple Patch Options to Consider Trying\n\nBecause of the patches’ rise in popularity, you have a host of great options to give a go:\n\nBest Budget Pimple Patch\n\nThis unmedicated hydrocolloid patch (meaning it does not contain active ingredients like salicylic acid) is clear so people will hardly know you’re wearing one.\n\nTry Clearasil Rapid Rescue Healing Spot Patches, $9.79, Target.com\n\nBest Multisize Pimple Patch\n\nThis pack comes with 24 unmedicated patches in three sizes, ranging from 7 millimeters (mm) to 12 mm, so you can pick the one best suited for your pimple size.\n\nTry Coxrx Acne Pimple Master Patch, $6, Ulta.com\n\nBest Medicated Pimple Patch\n\nDubbed “healing dots,” these hydrocolloid patches deliver vitamin A (the active ingredient in retinoids that exfoliates and cleans out pores), salicylic acid (a beta hydroxy acid that dissolves pore-clogging debris), and skin-calming aloe vera.\n\nTry Peace Out Acne Healing Dots, $19, Sephora.com\n\nRELATED: What Your Blemishes Tell You About Your Acne\n\nBest Subscription Pimple Patch\n\nEach box of the hydrocolloid patches comes in a count of 36 or 72 — and you can use the "subscribe and save" function to get a 20 percent discount and regular shipments, which take place every 30 to 60 days.

Pimple patches are unlikely to work for blackheads, according to Hero Cosmetics.\n\nIf your breakouts look more like a multitude of small red bumps that have spread over a wide area of your face or you have cystic acne, you’re better off seeing your dermatologist, who can put you on a topical regimen that will treat your face as a whole and stop the cycle of acne (rather than continually playing defense to heal pimples as they pop up.)\n\nHow to Use a Pimple Patch to Help Shrink Blemishes\n\nAbove all, follow the directions on the brand you’re using.

To use pimple patches, first clean and moisturize your face as normal. Then apply the sticker to your pimple and wear it overnight. You can keep it on for your shower, as they’re waterproof.

They look like stickers — because they are stickers. More specifically, they’re acne stickers that are also known as acne or pimple patches.\n\nBasically, these are an old-school wound dressing. “Acne patches are made from hydrocolloid material. Hydrocolloid consists of gelatin or pectin,” says\xa0Debra Jaliman,\xa0MD, a New York City–based\xa0dermatologist and the author of\xa0Skin Rules.\xa0They may be made only of hydrocolloid or they might also be medicated with a common pimple-fighting ingredient like salicylic acid, she adds.\n\nHow Can Pimple Patches Help Get Rid of Acne?\n\nThink of these stickers as the ultimate spot treatments. They can help minimize the appearance of pimples while accelerating healing. Here’s how.\n\nThey “Suck” the Gunk Out of Your Pores\n\nIf you were a fan of pore strips way back when, you’ll love these. “These patches are effective because they absorb excess fluid and have a vacuum-like effect that gets out any dirt and oil that could be causing a breakout,” says Dr. Jaliman. “It then converts those impurities into a gel-like substance that sticks to the patch and is sealed away from the face.” Another perk: They may also prevent bacteria from entering the pimple and exacerbating redness and inflammation. This “sucking” effect is central to hydrocolloid technology, according to the bandage brand Nexcare.\n\nRELATED: 10 Surprising Causes of Adult Acne (and How to Get Rid of It)\n\nThey Can Help Prevent Touching and Picking\n\nIf you have a pimple, the one thing a dermatologist will tell you to do is enact a hands-off policy. And what is the one thing you’re guaranteed to do anyway? Pick it or pop it. (There’s a reason Dr. Pimple Popper videos are so popular on YouTube.) “What acne patches probably do the best job at is keeping the area covered so that you can’t pick at your blemish,” says Lauren Fine, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Chicago Cosmetic Surgery and Dermatology. Picking “99 percent of the time will make it worse because it triggers more inflammation, which increases healing time and makes it more likely to leave a mark, discoloration, or scar,” she says. It also drives the pus deeper into the skin, making it more likely to stick around.\n\nThey May Help Treat Your Blemish With Actives\n\nPimple patches that contain ingredients that help treat the breakout, like salicylic acid, might deliver some extra help to clear dirt and bacteria out of pores and speed clearing, says Jaliman. Indeed, the American Academy of Dermatology notes that salicylic acid, in addition to benzoyl peroxide, is one of the best ingredients to treat acne breakouts. It’s like giving a pimple a one-two punch. Some products also include skin-soothing ingredients such as aloe vera and vitamin A, which can help further reduce inflammation, research\xa0has shown.\n\nRELATED: 8 Diet Dos and Don’ts for Preventing Acne\n\n13 Natural Dry-Skin Remedies You Can DIY at Home\nThese natural skin treatments can be done at home with common pantry staples!\n2:22\n0 seconds of 2 minutes, 22 secondsVolume 0%\n\xa0\nWhich Types of Acne Are Pimple Patches Effective For?\n\nThese are meant as spot treatments only and are ideally used on whiteheads, which are caused by clogged pores, and maybe cysts that have come to a head, according to Hero Cosmetics, which manufactures hydrocolloid acne patches.

summary: Based on the provided text, here is a summary of the information related to gel acne patch reviews:

The text discusses the effectiveness of hydrocolloid patches for treating acne. These patches are designed to absorb pus from pimples, resulting in smaller and less inflamed blemishes. The author mentions trying different brands of patches and finding that Mighty Patch by Hero Cosmetics works better than others. The Mighty Patch has a 4.5-star rating and over 90,000 reviews on Amazon. The patches come in different sizes and are most effective on pimples with visible whiteheads. Users have reported seeing results in as quickly as a few hours. The patches turn white as they absorb pus, and they help reduce the size and pain of pimples. The author also compares Mighty Patch to other brands like COSRX and finds that Mighty Patch is more effective. The main drawback of the patches is that they can be noticeable when worn in public, but the company offers invisible patches as a solution. The patches also prevent touching and picking of pimples, which can lead to irritation and scarring. Overall, the author highly recommends using hydrocolloid patches, particularly Mighty Patch, for treating acne.

summary: Based on the provided reference information, here is a summary of the text:

The article explains that gel-type acne patches, also known as pimple patches, are made from hydrocolloid material, which consists of gelatin or pectin. These patches can help minimize the appearance of pimples and accelerate healing. They work by absorbing excess fluid, dirt, and oil from the pores, converting them into a gel-like substance that sticks to the patch and is sealed away from the face. This process helps prevent bacteria from entering the pimple and exacerbating redness and inflammation.

Pimple patches are effective for whiteheads and cysts that have come to a head. Some patches are medicated with ingredients like salicylic acid, which can help clear dirt and bacteria from pores and speed up clearing. However, they are unlikely to work for blackheads.

In terms of usage, pimple patches are best used as overnight treatments. They can be applied to clean and moisturized skin, left on overnight, and washed off in the morning. Some people also wear them during the day and apply makeup on top.

The article also provides recommendations for different pimple patch options, including budget patches, multisize patches, medicated patches, subscription patches, and patches specifically designed for emerging pimples.

Overall, the article provides information about the benefits and usage of gel-type acne patches, but it does not directly provide reactions or feedback from social media, forums, or review sites.

There are various options available for pimple patches, including budget options, multisize patches, medicated patches, subscription options, and kits for emerging pimples. 

Overall, pimple patches can be an effective way to deliver medication, prevent picking, and speed up healing time for individual pimples. They are best worn overnight and can be used as part of a skincare routine to achieve clearer skin.

They work by absorbing excess fluid, dirt, and oil from the pores, converting them into a gel-like substance that sticks to the patch and is sealed away from the face. This process helps prevent bacteria from entering the pimple and exacerbating redness and inflammation.

Pimple patches are effective for spot treatments and are ideally used on whiteheads or cysts that have come to a head. Some patches are medicated with ingredients like salicylic acid, which can help clear dirt and bacteria from the pores. However, they are unlikely to work for blackheads.

In addition to their acne-fighting properties, pimple patches can also help prevent touching and picking at the blemish, which can worsen inflammation and increase healing time. They are best used as overnight treatments, as skin cells regenerate during sleep, and the patches can tap into the natural healing process. Pimple patches are clear and can be worn during the day, allowing for the application of makeup on top.

There are various options available for pimple patches, including budget options, multi-size patches, medicated patches, subscription options, and kits for emerging pimples.

Overall, pimple patches can be an effective way to deliver medication, prevent picking, and speed up healing time for individual pimples.

Pimple patches are effective for spot treatments and are ideally used on whiteheads or cysts that have come to a head. They may also be used on red, painful pimples for which the pus has not yet come to the surface. However, they are unlikely to work for blackheads.

Pimple patches can also help prevent touching and picking at the blemish, which can worsen inflammation and increase healing time. Some patches contain ingredients like salicylic acid, which can further help clear dirt and bacteria from the pores and reduce inflammation.

To use a pimple patch, clean and moisturize the face as normal, then apply the patch to the pimple and wear it overnight. The patches are waterproof and can be kept on during a shower. They can also be worn during the day and makeup can be applied on top of them.

There are various brands of pimple patches available, including unmedicated patches, multisize patches, medicated patches with ingredients like vitamin A and salicylic acid, and subscription options for regular shipments.

summary: Based on the provided text, here is a comprehensive summary of the information related to gel type acne patches:

Gel type acne patches, also known as acne or pimple patches, are made from hydrocolloid material, which consists of gelatin or pectin. These patches can help minimize the appearance of pimples and accelerate healing.

One of the main benefits of gel type acne patches is their ability to absorb excess fluid and dirt from the pores, preventing breakouts and reducing redness and inflammation. They create a vacuum-like effect, converting impurities into a gel-like substance that sticks to the patch and is sealed away from the face.

Furthermore, gel type acne patches can help prevent touching and picking at pimples, which can worsen inflammation and increase healing time. By keeping the area covered, the patches act as a barrier and discourage picking.

Some gel type acne patches also contain active ingredients like salicylic acid, which can help treat breakouts by clearing dirt and bacteria from the pores. These patches may also include soothing ingredients like aloe vera and vitamin A to reduce inflammation.

Gel type acne patches are most effective for whiteheads and cysts that have come to a head. They may not work as well for blackheads. For severe acne or widespread breakouts, it is recommended to consult a dermatologist for a comprehensive treatment plan.

To use gel type acne patches, clean and moisturize the face as usual, then apply the patch to the pimple and leave it on overnight. They can also be worn during the day, and makeup can be applied on top of them.

There are various options available for gel type acne patches, including budget options, multi-size patches, medicated patches, subscription options, and kits for emerging pimples.

These patches are designed to absorb pus from pimples, resulting in smaller and less inflamed blemishes. The author mentions trying different brands of patches and finding that Mighty Patch by Hero Cosmetics works better than others. The Mighty Patch has a 4.5-star rating and over 90,000 reviews on Amazon. The patches come in different sizes and are most effective on pimples with visible whiteheads. Users have reported seeing results in as quickly as a few hours. The patches turn white as they absorb pus, and they help reduce the size and pain of pimples.
