Market Size & Trends

The global autonomous AI and autonomous agents market size was valued at USD 3.93 billion in 2022 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.8% from 2023 to 2030. The “autonomous” or “self-driving” terminologies are used to describe artificial intelligence systems that can independently operate and make decisions, without the need for human intervention. This was particularly true in the nascent development stages of self-driving cars, where companies such as Waymo, Tesla, and traditional automakers were building autonomous vehicles. Autonomous agents were keen on developing virtual assistants, including Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and Google’s Assistant. By using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to understand and answer user queries, these virtual assistants became more advanced and autonomous.

Autonomous agents were used in the field of robotics to develop robots for numerous applications, such as healthcare, warehouse automation,  and agriculture. Businesses focused on investing in the research and development (R&D) activities to develop robots that could operate independently in various environments. The healthcare industry has adopted autonomous AI to deploy systems that could assist healthcare professionals in various tasks, including drug discovery, making medical diagnoses, and even performing robotic surgery. The goal of these systems was to improve the quality of care for patients.

In the financial sector, autonomous agents have been used in algorithmic trading, fraud detection, and customer service. They could process large amounts of financial information and make real-time decisions.

BabyAGI

BabyAGI

This Python script is an example of an AI-powered task management system. The system uses OpenAI and Chroma to create, prioritize, and execute tasks. The main idea behind this system is that it creates tasks based on the result of previous tasks and a predefined objective. The script then uses OpenAI's natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to create new tasks based on the objective, and Chroma to store and retrieve task results for context. This is a pared-down version of the original Task-Driven Autonomous Agent. The script works by running an infinite loop that does the following steps: 1. Pulls the first task from the task list. 2. Sends the task to the execution agent, which uses OpenAI's API to complete the task based on the context. 3. Enriches the result and stores it in Chroma. 4. Creates new tasks and reprioritizes the task list based on the objective and the result of the previous task.

AI Agents Guide

An AI agent is a software or robot that simulates human behavior and decision-making processes to interact with its environment in order to accomplish goals. AI agents can make decisions based on the data they receive from their environment as well as their programmed instructions. They may be designed to act autonomously, using Machine Learning algorithms such as Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. AI agents are used in many areas of robotics and automation, especially when tasks require complex decision-making and learning capabilities.

AI agents can be broken down into two main types: reactive agents and goal-based agents. Reactive agents take action based on their environment without setting any specific goals ahead of time. Examples of reactive AI agents include self-driving cars, which use sensor data combined with GPS coordinates to navigate roads while avoiding obstacles like other vehicles, pedestrians, etc., or robotic vacuum cleaners that continuously monitor the room for dirt and debris while cleaning up accordingly. Goal-based AI agents are programmed with specific goals in mind, such as playing a board game or navigating a maze. As they interact with the environment, they take action based on what will help them achieve their goal most effectively.

Another example of an AI agent is an expert system -- specifically developed for particular task domains like medical diagnosis or forecasting weather patterns -- that mimics the reasoning process of humans experts by combining large amounts of data about different scenarios with rules provided by domain experts. Expert systems can often perform better and faster than human experts in certain situations due to their consistent processing speed and access to vast amounts of data about different scenarios.

Lastly, Intelligent Agents such as chatbots are becoming increasingly popular today for providing customer support via webpages or messaging apps like Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp because they can respond quickly at scale without human assistance; machine learning technology allows these chatbots to understand conversational language so they can handle conversations more naturally than rule-based approaches alone do not provide this level of accuracy.

In short, AI Agents encompass many technologies — from autonomous robots to expert systems — that simulate human behavior in order to complete tasks autonomously or assist people more efficiently given large quantities of available data pertaining to a particular situation.

Features of AI Agents
Natural Language Processing (NLP): AI agents use NLP to understand and interpret natural language inputs such as spoken commands, questions, and requests. This technology helps them identify the key components of user input in order to generate a response.

Types of AI Agents
Reactive Machines: These AI agents are programmed to react to specific conditions in their environment, with no memory or record of past events. They take input from the environment and react accordingly without any learning or adaptation abilities. Examples include IBM’s Deep Blue chess-playing program or the robot vacuum cleaners on the market today.
Limited Memory Agents: Limited memory AI agents remember select past events and use that information to make decisions. Self-driving car algorithms are a good example of this type of agent as they can remember traffic patterns, roadblocks, signage and other data points which they must use when making decisions while in transit.
Theory of Mind Agents: More advanced AI agents are able to understand a person's intentions, motives and desires based on their behavior. Natural language processing technology is an example of a Theory of Mind Agent as it can provide human-like language understanding capabilities for artificial intelligence systems.
Self-Aware Agents: This advanced form of artificial intelligence agent is equipped with self-awareness or sense of identity and purpose. These agents continuously learn by observing their environment and adapting based on new information gathered from various sources such as camera images, audio inputs, written text etc., creating more sophisticated behavior with each iteration.
Benefits of AI Agents
Increased Efficiency: AI agents can automate mundane tasks, allowing the user to focus on more important work. This can significantly improve efficiency and productivity in businesses.
Improved Decision Making: AI agents can access vast amounts of data and analyze it quickly, giving users insights into their decision-making process that they couldn’t have otherwise obtained. This makes it easier for a user to make informed decisions with confidence.
Enhanced Customer Service: AI agents can be used to provide customers with personalized service, increasing customer satisfaction levels and loyalty. By having an AI agent handle customer inquiries, businesses are able to respond quickly and accurately to customer requests.
Automated Personalization: AI agents can be used to automate personalized content delivery based on preferences or interests indicated by the user. This allows businesses to tailor their services in order to better serve their customers, resulting in higher engagement levels and sales conversions.
Cost Savings: By automating certain tasks through the use of AI agents, businesses can reduce labor costs associated with manual processes as well as time spent managing those processes. This leads to improved resource utilization and cost savings over time.

What is an AI agent? What is an autonomous AI agent?

AI agents have been around since the 1980s when computer scientists began exploring how to develop smart software that could interact like humans. Since then, the concept has evolved to include AI agents that can make decisions and complete tasks independently.

An AI agent is a software program designed to interact with its environment, perceive the data it receives, and take actions based on that data to achieve specific goals. AI agents simulate intelligent behavior, and they can be as simple as rule-based systems or as complex as advanced machine learning models. They use predetermined rules or trained models to make decisions and might need external control or supervision.

An autonomous AI agent is an advanced software program that can operate independently without human control. It can think, act, and learn on its own, without needing constant input from humans. These agents are widely used in different industries, like healthcare, finance, and banking, to make things run smoother and more efficiently. They can adjust to new situations, learn from their experiences, and make decisions using their own internal systems.

For example:

AutoGPT is an AI agent that can generate human-like text responses. It can comprehend the context of the conversation and generate relevant responses accordingly.
BabyAGI is an autonomous AI agent that can independently learn and perform tasks like understanding natural language, analyzing images, identifying objects, following simple commands, etc.
AgentGPT is an intelligent virtual agent designed to interact with customers and provide them with personalized recommendations. It can understand natural language and provide relevant responses based on customer queries.

Both AI tools and AI agents can perform tasks autonomously to an extent. So what sets them apart? What qualifies an AI tool as an agent? Let’s find out!

Characteristics of an AI agent

While AI tools and agents are software programs designed to automate tasks, specific key characteristics differentiate AI agents as more sophisticated AI software.

You can consider an AI tool as an AI agent when it has the following characteristics:

Autonomy: An AI virtual agent is capable of performing tasks independently without requiring constant human intervention or input.
Perception: The agent function senses and interprets the environment they operate in through various sensors, such as cameras or microphones.
Reactivity: An AI agent can assess the environment and respond accordingly to achieve its goals.
Reasoning and decision-making: AI agents are intelligent tools that can analyze data and make decisions to achieve goals. They use reasoning techniques and algorithms to process information and take appropriate actions.
Learning: They can learn and enhance their performance through machine, deep, and reinforcement learning elements and techniques.
Communication: AI agents can communicate with other agents or humans using different methods, like understanding and responding to natural language, recognizing speech, and exchanging messages through text.
Goal-oriented: They are designed to achieve specific goals, which can be pre-defined or learned through interactions with the environment.

So far, we have a basic understanding of an agent in AI or intelligent agent definition. But how does an AI agent work? Let’s break it down in the next section as we understand the structure of an agent.

Understanding the structure of an AI agent

At its core, an AI agent is made up of four components: the environment, sensors, actuators, and the decision-making mechanism.

1. Environment

The environment refers to the area or domain in which an AI agent operates. It can be a physical space, like a factory floor, or a digital space, like a website.

2. Sensors

Sensors are the tools that an AI agent uses to perceive its environment. These can be cameras, microphones, or any other sensory input that the AI agent can use to understand what is happening around it.

3. Actuators

Actuators are the tools that an AI agent uses to interact with its environment. These can be things like robotic arms, computer screens, or any other device the AI agent can use to change the environment.

4. Decision-making mechanism

A decision-making mechanism is the brain of an AI agent. It processes the information gathered by the sensors and decides what action to take using the actuators. The decision-making mechanism is where the real magic happens.

AI agents use various decision-making mechanisms, such as rule-based systems, expert systems, and neural networks, to make informed choices and perform tasks effectively.

5. Learning system

The learning system enables the AI agent to learn from its experiences and interactions with the environment. It uses techniques like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning to improve the performance of the AI agent over time.

By understanding the environment, sensors, actuators, and decision-making mechanisms, developers can create AI agents to perform specific tasks accurately and efficiently. As AI technology evolves, we can expect new types of AI agents with even more sophisticated structures and capabilities.

With the AI agent definition and intelligent agent purpose known to you, it’s time to dive deeper into the agent function and analyze how an AI agent works in our upcoming section.

How does an AI agent work?

An AI agent works by perceiving its environment, processing information, and taking action to achieve specific goals or tasks. The process usually involves the following steps:

Step 1: Perceiving the environment

An autonomous AI agent first needs to gather information about its environment. It can do so using sensors or collecting data from various sources.

Step 2: Processing input data

The agent takes the knowledge gathered in Step 1 and prepares it for processing. This may include organizing the data, creating a knowledge base, or making internal representations that the agent can understand and work with.

Step 3: Decision-making

The agent uses reasoning techniques like logic or statistical analysis to make an informed decision based on its knowledge base and goals. This can involve applying pre-determined rules or machine learning algorithms.

Step 4: Planning and executing an action

The agent makes a plan or a series of steps to reach its goals. This may involve creating a step-by-step strategy, optimizing resource allocation, or considering various limitations and priorities. Based on its plan, the agent executes all the steps to achieve the desired goal. It can also receive feedback or new information from the environment, which can be used to adjust its future actions or update its knowledge base.

Step 5: Learning and Improvement

After taking action, the agent can learn from its own experiences. This feedback loop allows the agent to improve performance and adapt to new situations and environments.

In conclusion, autonomous AI agents collect and analyze data, preprocess it, make decisions based on machine learning algorithms, take action, and receive feedback. Now, let us simplify the working of an autonomous AI agent by taking the example of AutoGPT and BabyAGI, the modern-day and most commonly used autonomous agents.

What is AutoGPT?

AutoGPT is like a smart assistant that can handle tasks on its own. It uses the power of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, the Large Language Models (LLMs), to complete tasks without needing constant instructions. Unlike other models that rely on specific prompts, AutoGPT comes up with its own prompts to achieve its goals. Interestingly, its abilities go beyond the fed database; it can also search the web or other external sources to gather and filter out authentic information.

How does AutoGPT work?

Because AutoGPT is a recursive AI model, it overcomes traditional AI limitations by using its own results to tackle complex tasks. Here is how the model processes input and delivers relevant output:

1. Giving it a name and a role: When you start AutoGPT, give it a name and tell it what it needs to do. This helps the system understand the task and make decisions accordingly.

2. Training on the provided data: AutoGPT begins by learning from the information you provide. It studies the data to understand its patterns and details, helping it grasp the task better.

3. Generating prompts: With its knowledge base in place, AutoGPT develops its own prompts based on what it needs to achieve. These prompts serve as the basis for its decision-making, guiding it through the tasks.

4. Collecting data independently: AutoGPT doesn’t rely only on the initial data. It autonomously searches the internet and other sources, gathering more information to improve its understanding and accuracy.

5. Evaluating and filtering data: The system carefully examines the collected data, checking its authenticity and relevance. It removes any incorrect or low-quality information, making sure its knowledge base is reliable.

6. Continuous improvement: AutoGPT believes in constant refinement. It learns from the results it generates and uses feedback to adapt and enhance its future responses. This ongoing process helps the system refine its strategies and improve over time.

7. Generating the output: Finally, AutoGPT produces its output based on its reasoning process. It combines what it has learned, the filtered data, and the context to generate a well-informed and suitable response to the given task.

AutoGPT unveils itself as an independent problem-solver with impressive decision-making skills. It showcases the sheer power of AI, providing a glimpse into the potential of intelligent systems that effortlessly handle complex tasks with minimal human input. Arguably, AutoGPT paves the way for a future where machines become trusted partners in navigating our intricate world.

What is BabyAGI?

BabyAGI is a fascinating concept in the field of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It’s based on generative AI and focuses on recreating the cognitive abilities seen in young children. This research project focuses on building AI systems capable of learning and gaining knowledge from diverse sources, just like young children do!

More specifically, BabyAGI is an advanced computer program that operates with a remarkable level of autonomy. It can work independently, accomplishing tasks without users having to provide specific instructions. BabyAGI is built upon a combination of powerful programs, including Chat GPT-4, LangChain, and Pinecone.

When an AI uses other programs or tools to accomplish tasks, it is known as Stacking. Baby AGI is one of the more robust Stacking tools created and built on Chat GPT-4. You can use this technology for various applications, including language translation, image recognition, and decision-making processes. BabyAGI is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the AI industry.

How does BabyAGI work?

Baby AGI is a Python script that leverages the capabilities of OpenAI and Pinecone APIs, along with the LangChain framework, to manage and execute tasks. Its process involves generating tasks based on high-level objectives predefined by the user.

Using OpenAI’s natural language processing (NLP) abilities, the BabyAGI system creates new tasks aligned with the objectives. Moreover, it uses PineCone to store task results and the LangChain framework to make decisions.

Here’s how the system operates in a loop with four steps:

1. Retrieve the first task from the task list.
2. Send the task to the execution agent, which utilizes the OpenAI API to complete the task based on the available context.
3. Store the result in Pinecone for future reference.
4. Generate and prioritize new tasks based on the previous task’s objective and outcome.

This continuous loop ensures that tasks are consistently executed, prioritized, and updated based on the desired objective.

While the development of a true BabyAGI is still a long way off, there’s daily progress towards a more comprehensive performance. AI experts are actively researching and experimenting to create an AI system that can truly understand and navigate the world like a young human.

What are the type of AI agents?

Here are the five main types of AI agents:

Simple reflex agents are programmed to respond to specific environmental stimuli based on pre-defined rules.
Model-based reflex agents are reactive agents that maintain an internal model of the environment and use it to make decisions.
Goal-based agents execute a program to achieve specific goals and take actions based on evaluating the current state of the environment.
Utility-based agents consider the potential outcomes of their actions and choose the one that maximizes the expected utility.
Learning agents execute machine learning techniques to improve their decision-making over time.
What are the advantages of using AI agents?

AI agents offer businesses the potential to streamline operations, make informed decisions, improve customer experiences, and drive growth and competitiveness in the digital age.

1. Increased efficiency

AI agents can automate repetitive tasks, allowing businesses to complete them faster and more accurately. This efficiency improvement frees employees’ time to focus on more business-critical tasks and improves productivity.

2. Better decision-making

AI agents can analyze large amounts of data and provide valuable insights to support decision-making processes. By leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning, AI agents can identify patterns, trends, and correlations that humans may overlook.

3. Improved customer experience

AI agents can provide personalized and timely interactions with customers, enhancing their experience. They can offer instant support, answer queries, and provide recommendations, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.

4. Cost savings

By automating tasks, AI agents can reduce the need for human resources and manual labor, resulting in cost savings for businesses. They can handle high-volume, repetitive tasks without fatigue or errors.

Most common challenges you may face while using an AI agent

Autonomous AI agents have become increasingly popular in recent years, with many brands implementing them for various purposes. However, several challenges come with using these agents. Some of the most common challenges are:

Data bias: An autonomous artificial intelligence agent program relies heavily on data to make decisions. If the data they use is biased, it can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Amazon’s AI recruiting tool was biased against women, leading to a skewed hiring process.
Lack of accountability: Proactive agents can make decisions without human intervention, so holding them accountable for their actions can be difficult. Uber’s autonomous vehicle that struck and killed a pedestrian in 2018 raised questions about who was responsible.
Lack of transparency: The decision-making processes of a learning agent can be complex and opaque, making it difficult to understand how they arrive at certain decisions.
Ethical considerations: A rational agent can make decisions with ethical implications, and it can be challenging to program them to make ethical decisions. Microsoft’s chatbot, Tay, was shut down after it started making racist and sexist comments.
Security risks: Software agents can be vulnerable to cyber attacks, compromising their decision-making processes or leading to data breaches.
Lack of adaptability: Autonomous AI agents act according to their training data, which means they can struggle to adapt to new situations or contexts.
What are the applications of AI agents?

Autonomous AI agents have numerous applications in various industries, including:

Healthcare: Autonomous artificial intelligence agents can assist in diagnosing, treating, and monitoring patients. IBM Watson Health is an AI agent that can analyze medical data to identify potential health issues and recommend treatment options.
Finance: They can analyze financial data, detect fraud, and make investment recommendations. Charles Schwab uses an AI agent called Intelligent Portfolio to create and manage portfolios based on customers’ investment goals.
Retail: Agents can provide personalized recommendations, improve supply chain management, and enhance customer experience. Amazon’s Alexa is an AI agent that can recommend products, place orders, and track shipments.
Manufacturing: Intelligent agents can optimize production processes, predict maintenance needs, and improve product quality. General Electric uses an AI agent called Predix to monitor machines in real-time to predict and prevent equipment failures.

How our new AI feature earned 5% adoption in its first week
Garth Griffin5:00 AM GMT+9•October 3, 2023

Garth Griffin
Contributor
Garth Griffin is co-founder and CTO of Gigasheet, a web-based, no-code big data spreadsheet tool. He is a pioneering data scientist and an esteemed member of Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Honor Society.

Since the launch of ChatGPT, a stampede of technology company leaders has been chasing the buzz: Everywhere I turn, another company is trumpeting their pioneering AI feature. But real business value comes from delivering product capabilities that matter to users, not just from using hot tech.

We achieved a 10x better return on engineering effort with AI by starting with core principles for what users need from your product, building an AI capability that supports that vision, and then measuring adoption to make sure it hits the mark.

Our first AI product feature was not aligned with this idea, and it took a month to reach a disappointing 0.5% adoption among returning users. After recentering on our core principles for what our users need from our product, we developed an “AI as agent” approach and shipped a new AI capability that exploded to 5% adoption in the first week. This formula for success in AI can be applied to almost any software product.

The waste of hype haste

Many startups, like ours, are often tempted by the allure of integrating the latest technology without a clear strategy. So after the groundbreaking release of the various incarnations of generative pretrained transformer (GPT) models from OpenAI, we began looking for a way to use large language model (LLM) AI technology in our product. Soon enough, we’d secured our spot aboard the hype train with a new AI-driven element in production.

This first AI capability was a small summarization feature that uses GPT to write a short paragraph describing each file our user uploads into our product. It gave us something to talk about and we made some marketing content, but it didn’t have a meaningful impact on our user experience.

Many startups are often tempted by the allure of integrating the latest technology without a clear strategy.

We knew this because none of our key metrics showed an appreciable change. Only 0.5% of returning users interacted with the description in the first month. Moreover, there was no improvement in user activation and no change in the pace of user signups.

When we thought about it from a wider perspective, it was clear that this feature would never move those metrics. The core value proposition of our product is about big data analysis and using data to understand the world.

Generating a few words about the uploaded file is not going to result in any significant analytical insight, which means it’s not going to do much to help our users. In our haste to deliver something AI-related, we’d missed out on delivering actual value.

Success with AI as agent: 10x better return

The AI approach that gave us success is an “AI as agent” principle that empowers our users to interact with data in our product via natural language. This recipe can be applied to just about any software product that is built on top of API calls.

After our initial AI feature, we’d checked the box, but we weren’t satisfied because we knew we could do better for our users. So we did what software engineers have been doing since the invention of programming languages, which was to get together for a hackathon. From this hackathon, we implemented an AI agent that acts on behalf of the user.

The agent uses our own product by making API calls to the same API endpoints that our web front end calls. It constructs the API calls based on a natural language conversation with the user, attempting to fulfill what the user is asking it to do. The agent’s actions are manifested in our web user interface as a result of the API calls, just as if the user had taken the actions themselves.

The widely used chatbot ChatGPT was designed to generate digital text, everything from poetry to term papers to computer programs. But when a team of artificial intelligence researchers at the computer chip company Nvidia got their hands on the chatbot’s underlying technology, they realized it could do a lot more.

Within weeks, they taught it to play Minecraft, one of the world’s most popular video games. Inside Minecraft’s digital universe, it learned to swim, gather plants, hunt pigs, mine gold and build houses.

“It can go into the Minecraft world and explore by itself and collect materials by itself and get better and better at all kinds of skills,” said a Nvidia senior research scientist, Linxi Fan, who is known as Jim.

What is an AI agent?

An AI agent is a system that can perceive its environment, act upon it, and achieve some goals. It can be either reactive, meaning it responds to stimuli without memory or planning, or proactive, meaning it has some internal state and can plan ahead. An AI agent can also be either autonomous, meaning it operates independently of human control, or cooperative, meaning it collaborates with other agents or humans. Depending on the complexity and intelligence of the agent, it can be classified into different types, such as reflex agents, goal-based agents, utility-based agents, or learning agents.

Abid Mohammed

Architecting and engineering applications, data platforms and products

I have implemented the following types of AI agents
 - An agent that answers user questions based on an internal enterprise knowledge base using Retrieval Augmentation with LLM.
- An agent when given a task, searches on the internet to find the relevant content, and then synthesizes and summarizes it into a report for the user. The report can be emailed to the user when ready.
- I am currently working on an agent that combines structured data from databases along with non-structured data like documents to answer user questions. The answers include text, data tables and visualizations.

As a data scientist, I can say that while grouping AI agents into reflex, goal-based, utility-based, or learning agents offers a broad framework, it's crucial to understand the particular situation in which they are being used. 

A reflex agent, for instance, might be sufficient in industrial settings to stop machinery when dangerous conditions are found. However, in environments that are more complex, such as financial markets, a learning agent may be more suitable to adjust to shifting economic conditions. 

Selecting the ideal agent for the job can be made easier by being aware of the subtleties of each type.

How do you design an AI agent?

Designing an AI agent involves defining its purpose, scope, and functionality. You need to identify the problem that the agent will solve, the users that will interact with it, and the constraints that will limit it. You also need to specify the agent's inputs, outputs, actions, and goals. A common framework for designing AI agents is the rational agent approach, which aims to make the agent act in the best possible way given its knowledge and preferences. You can use various tools and methods to design an AI agent, such as user stories, use cases, scenarios, or diagrams.

An AI agent's design phase is possibly its most important because it lays the groundwork for everything that comes after. 

Beyond simply defining the agent's purpose and scope, it's crucial to make sure that the design of the agent is in line with the organization's overarching goals. 

As well as reducing risks later in the agent's lifecycle, taking ethical considerations and possible unintended consequences into account during the design phase can save a significant amount of rework.

Development entails more than just choosing the appropriate tools or writing code. It also includes understanding the data with which the agent will be working. Data that is accurate, complete, and easy to understand is essential for any AI system. It's equally important to maintain an iterative mindset when creating an AI agent. The performance and relevance of the agent can be greatly improved by periodically reviewing and adjusting its logic in light of fresh information or user feedback.

While programming languages, platforms, and algorithms are vital in AI development, data stands paramount. It's AI's lifeblood. No matter what algorithm or methodology is used to train an AI agent,  remember that what AI can understand and its predictions come down to the quality of the data provided. Its efficacy and predictions rely heavily on data quality. Poor data leads to flawed outcomes. Ensuring data quality is challenging but critical for AI success. AI uses this data to identify patterns, predict results, and act. The broader and more accurate the data, the higher AI's success. A robust AI strategy mandates a sound data strategy, ensuring data is aptly captured, curated, and consumed.

How do you evaluate an AI agent?

Evaluating an AI agent involves testing its performance, usability, and ethics. You need to measure how well the agent achieves its goals, how easy and satisfying it is to use, and how fair and responsible it is. You can use various metrics and methods to evaluate an AI agent, such as accuracy, speed, efficiency, error rate, user satisfaction, user feedback, or ethical principles. You can also use various tools and techniques to evaluate an AI agent, such as unit testing, debugging, simulation, validation, verification, or user testing.

Add your perspective
Sahir Maharaj

Data Scientist | AI Engineer | Bring me data, I will show you insights | 170+ solutions delivered | Top 1% Power BI Community Champion

I prefer to think of evaluation as an ongoing process as opposed to a singular event. The environment for AI is constantly changing due to the evolution of user needs, the availability of new data, and the development of computational methods. As a result, it's crucial to have a reliable monitoring system in place to consistently evaluate an agent's performance and guarantee that it stays in line with its goals. A holistic evaluation also requires input from a variety of stakeholders, including from groups that may be impacted by the agent's actions.

This may be the most important question. Photoshop helped photo editors work quickly. The phone allowed people to communicate faster than letters. Once the tool was made, people who figured out how to use it best rose to the top as their productivity was far greater. Collaboration with an AI will accelerate productivity in almost every field. For the reader, if you provide an AI agent with a very specific goal (like on ChatGPT), the agent can generate cover letters, essays, data summarization, images, video, audio, etc. If you figure out how to collaborate with AI best to reach your goals faster, you will rise to the top.

Overview of AI Agents

An AI agent is a software application that automates tasks around the home, workplace, or any other environment. It’s an automated system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to learn from its experiences and interact with its environment in order to complete tasks.

AI agents can do anything from recognizing patterns in data sets, to controlling robotic arms as part of a production line, to playing board games like chess or go. Agents are often used in robotics applications because they can quickly process data and decisions while still being able to respond effectively when given certain conditions or requirements. Depending on their design, AI agents can be broadly classified into two main categories: reactive agents and goal-based agents.

Reactive agents are designed for simple tasks that don't require much cognitive effort. These types of agents receive sensory input from their environment and then react accordingly without any prior knowledge or planning. They don't need memories since they only respond to what is happening right now, making them great for short term goals such as automated customer service systems or robotics arms on factory floors.

Goal-based AI agents work differently than reactive ones by using learning algorithms such as reinforcement learning or deep learning techniques which allow them to form plans on how best to reach their goal efficiently. This type of agent requires long-term memory and understanding objectives in order to make decisions based on past experience instead of just responding directly each time it receives new information, making it better suited for more complex tasks requiring problem solving skills such as playing board games against another player or navigating autonomous cars through traffic safely.

Overall, AI agents are incredibly useful tools which can be used in a variety of different scenarios from navigation systems, robotics control systems, machine translation programs, virtual assistants; the possibilities are endless.

Why Use AI Agents?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents offer many advantages over traditional solutions. Here are a few reasons why AI agents are important and useful:

Enhanced Decision Making: AI agents can be used to make decisions according to data collected from various sources, enabling businesses to act on insights that would not have been possible with manual processes. This can help optimize processes and increase efficiency within the organization.
Increased Productivity: By automating repetitive tasks or complex jobs, AI can save time and boost productivity. It’s also able to quickly access massive amounts of data or process large volumes of information, allowing workers to focus on value-added tasks rather than mundane ones.
Improved Customer Service: AI agents are capable of understanding customer needs, providing rapid solutions and taking appropriate actions in order to offer a more personalized experience for customers throughout their journey with a product or service.
Reduced Risk: By analyzing data from the past and predicting future trends through advanced algorithms, AI has enabled organizations to identify risks before they arise and take preventive measures before it’s too late.
Cost Savings: As AI eliminates manual labor which requires additional costs such as employee salaries and benefits; it helps businesses reduce the total expenditure associated with operations by improving efficiency while minimizing errors caused due human intervention.
Access to Data: AI solutions have enabled businesses to collect, synthesize, and analyze large amounts of data from various sources in order to identify opportunities that can be used to create new products or services.
Automated Processes: AI helps in automating manual processes, such as document review or data entry, which can help organizations get more done with fewer resources and faster turnaround times.
Why Are AI Agents Important?

AI agents are an important part of modern technology. In the 21st century, AI agents provide humans with a range of capabilities and make our lives easier. From helping us solve complex problems to managing intricate tasks, AI agents enhance our daily lives by providing us with resources that would otherwise be impossible or difficult to access.

One way AI is becoming increasingly important is through its ability to automate tedious and time-consuming processes. Automation allows businesses to save time and money, while also increasing efficiency and accuracy in a variety of tasks. For example, AI bots can take on routine administrative responsibilities such as data entry or payment processing, freeing up employees’ time for other tasks that require more cognitive effort. Additionally, some industries rely entirely on machines for functions like automated customer service systems so customers can quickly receive answers to their questions without having to wait for human assistance.

AI also offers unique insights into diverse data sets through predictive analysis and machine learning algorithms which helps companies better understand consumers’ needs and desires so they can offer tailored experiences for each user. Businesses are able to use this information to optimize not only their products but how they interact with potential customers too, from personalizing content according to demographics or online behavior patterns, allowing them to create meaningful connections with customers every step of the way. This can also lead to improved marketing strategies resulting in increased sales conversions over time.

The applications of AI don’t stop there either; healthcare professionals are now leveraging this technology in order identify new treatments that could help patients fight disease faster than ever before, while transportation networks are optimizing urban traffic conditions by using connected vehicle intelligence combined with real-time environmental readings provided by smart infrastructure across many cities worldwide. These advancements are just two examples out of countless ways AI has been helping drive progress all around us making it an essential resource in today’s world.

Features of AI Agents
Natural Language Processing: AI agents can process and understand natural language, allowing for human-like interactions between users and machines. This technology enables users to ask questions or give commands in their own language rather than having to learn a formal coding language.
Machine Learning: AI agents use machine learning algorithms to continuously improve their performance based on data they receive from previous experiences. Specifically, the agent’s algorithms are designed to allow it to adjust its behavior by taking in input data and creating an internal model that better suits the task at hand.
Adaptability: AI agents are able to adapt quickly with new tasks and information presented to them which helps ensure higher accuracy when dealing with different scenarios or environments. This makes them particularly well suited for situations where quick decisions need to be made with limited information provided as they can adjust their responses accordingly with every encounter they experience.
Autonomy/Self Sufficiency: AI agents typically require minimal human interaction because of their ability to independently perform complex tasks without need for direct supervision or guidance from humans; allowing them the freedom of self-sufficiency within certain boundaries imposed by their programming limitations and ethical standards set by society or local laws depending on its application(s).
Problem Solving Capabilities: AI agents have problem solving capabilities built into their algorithmic structure that allows them to work through problems faster than conventional methods used by humans thanks mainly due to their automated processes working much quicker than manually operated ones; results are generated quicker helping organizations make informed decisions quicker compared manual task automation techniques too.
What Types of Users Can Benefit From AI Agents?
Businesses: AI agents can automate tasks, streamline customer service processes, and help optimize operations.
Consumers: AI agents can provide personalized product recommendations and help find the best deals on products and services.
Healthcare Professionals: AI agents can provide insight into patient care and diagnose medical conditions.
Government Agencies: AI agents can help detect fraud in tax returns, aid police departments in criminal investigations, and facilitate the efficient delivery of government services to citizens.
Educators: AI agents can be used to assess students’ knowledge, offer customized learning paths for students of all ages, and support teachers with classroom management tasks.
Marketers & Advertisers: AI agents can analyze data from online sources to create targeted campaigns and determine optimal ad placement for maximum ROI.
Automotive Professionals: AI agents are being used to automate vehicle diagnostics and fault detection as well as improve driving efficiency through predictive analytics.
Financial Institutions & Fintech Companies: AI-enabled financial advisors are increasingly becoming available to advise customers on investment decisions while automating internal compliance procedures across institutions.
Researchers: AI agents can be deployed to assist researchers in analyzing large datasets, identifying patterns and correlations, and helping to uncover hidden knowledge.
How Much Do AI Agents Cost?

The cost of AI agents can vary greatly depending on a variety of factors, such as the type of agent, its complexity and functionality, and how it will be used. For example, if you need an AI agent that is simple in nature but requires a lot of data input to complete tasks, then the cost may be relatively low. However, if you are seeking a more complex and custom-designed AI agent with sophisticated capabilities for specific scenarios or applications, then the costs can skyrocket quickly. Furthermore, larger businesses might have access to bulk discounts or multi-year contracts that offer substantial savings compared to smaller companies who might pay significantly more per unit.

It's important to remember that while many providers offer pricing on their websites based on variable monthly fees or subscription plans designed for small businesses, these plans don't consider the fact that underlying development costs increase dramatically as complexity escalates. At this point it's vital to engage with developers directly and discuss comprehensive solutions tailored specifically for each business’ use case; otherwise significant hidden expenses can result when demand increases unexpectedly or project parameters change during implementation.

In short, there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to what an AI agent will cost. The ultimate price tag depends heavily upon your project scope and specific needs; however taking into account variables like customization requirement level, scalability capability desired in response to changing conditions or growth demands within the ecosystem being served; plus anticipated data management needs should all contribute towards establishing an accurate expectation of costs before committing resources down any particular path for your AI initiatives.

AI Agents Risks
Over-Reliance on AI Systems: As AI systems become more advanced, it becomes easier to rely too heavily on their decision-making capabilities. This could lead to a situation where humans are essentially “outsourcing” important judgement calls without properly considering their implications.
Misuse of Data: AI systems require large amounts of data in order to function correctly, and this can leave them vulnerable to misuse or manipulation. If the data is inaccurate or biased, the resulting decisions from the system could be flawed or dangerous.
Unintended Consequences: AI agents are often designed for specific tasks and are not always able to handle unexpected events. In some cases, these unexpected occurrences could lead to serious safety concerns or hazardous situations.
Privacy Concerns: Many people worry about how their personal data is being used by companies that employ AI technology. With the emergence of facial recognition software and other tools utilizing deep learning algorithms, privacy concerns around the use of personal information have become more pronounced.
Security Breaches: AI agents can also be targeted by malicious actors who seek access to confidential information or use them as a vehicle for cybercrime activities such as ransomware attacks or phishing attempts.
Job Losses: AI agents are already being used to automate certain jobs, and it is expected that this trend will continue as technology advances. This could lead to significant job losses for people without the proper skillset or education necessary to adapt.
AI Agents Integrations

There are several types of software that can be integrated with AI agents. Business communication and collaboration applications such as Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex and Zoom can integrate with virtual assistants for customer service or other user assistance tasks. Mobile apps like Google Maps use AI agents to provide users with turn-by-turn navigation instructions. Additionally, some eCommerce websites utilize AI agents to make personalized product recommendations to customers based on their browsing history.

It’s an automated system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to learn from its experiences and interact with its environment in order to complete tasks.\n\nAI agents can do anything from recognizing patterns in data sets, to controlling robotic arms as part of a production line, to playing board games like chess or go. Agents are often used in robotics applications because they can quickly process data and decisions while still being able to respond effectively when given certain conditions or requirements. Depending on their design, AI agents can be broadly classified into two main categories: reactive agents and goal-based agents.\n\nReactive agents are designed for simple tasks that don\'t require much cognitive effort. These types of agents receive sensory input from their environment and then react accordingly without any prior knowledge or planning. They don\'t need memories since they only respond to what is happening right now, making them great for short term goals such as automated customer service systems or robotics arms on factory floors.\n\nGoal-based AI agents work differently than reactive ones by using learning algorithms such as reinforcement learning or deep learning techniques which allow them to form plans on how best to reach their goal efficiently. This type of agent requires long-term memory and understanding objectives in order to make decisions based on past experience instead of just responding directly each time it receives new information, making it better suited for more complex tasks requiring problem solving skills such as playing board games against another player or navigating autonomous cars through traffic safely.\n\nOverall, AI agents are incredibly useful tools which can be used in a variety of different scenarios from navigation systems, robotics control systems, machine translation programs, virtual assistants; the possibilities are endless.\n\nWhy Use AI Agents?\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) agents offer many advantages over traditional solutions. Here are a few reasons why AI agents are important and useful:\n\nEnhanced Decision Making: AI agents can be used to make decisions according to data collected from various sources, enabling businesses to act on insights that would not have been possible with manual processes. This can help optimize processes and increase efficiency within the organization.\nIncreased Productivity: By automating repetitive tasks or complex jobs, AI can save time and boost productivity. It’s also able to quickly access massive amounts of data or process large volumes of information, allowing workers to focus on value-added tasks rather than mundane ones.\nImproved Customer Service: AI agents are capable of understanding customer needs, providing rapid solutions and taking appropriate actions in order to offer a more personalized experience for customers throughout their journey with a product or service.\nReduced Risk: By analyzing data from the past and predicting future trends through advanced algorithms, AI has enabled organizations to identify risks before they arise and take preventive measures before it’s too late.\nCost Savings: As AI eliminates manual labor which requires additional costs such as employee salaries and benefits; it helps businesses reduce the total expenditure associated with operations by improving efficiency while minimizing errors caused due human intervention.\nAccess to Data: AI solutions have enabled businesses to collect, synthesize, and analyze large amounts of data from various sources in order to identify opportunities that can be used to create new products or services.\nAutomated Processes: AI helps in automating manual processes, such as document review or data entry, which can help organizations get more done with fewer resources and faster turnaround times.\nWhy Are AI Agents Important?\n\nAI agents are an important part of modern technology. In the 21st century, AI agents provide humans with a range of capabilities and make our lives easier. From helping us solve complex problems to managing intricate tasks, AI agents enhance our daily lives by providing us with resources that would otherwise be impossible or difficult to access.\n\nOne way AI is becoming increasingly important is through its ability to automate tedious and time-consuming processes. Automation allows businesses to save time and money, while also increasing efficiency and accuracy in a variety of tasks. For example, AI bots can take on routine administrative responsibilities such as data entry or payment processing, freeing up employees’ time for other tasks that require more cognitive effort. Additionally, some industries rely entirely on machines for functions like automated customer service systems so customers can quickly receive answers to their questions without having to wait for human assistance.\n\nAI also offers unique insights into diverse data sets through predictive analysis and machine learning algorithms which helps companies better understand consumers’ needs and desires so they can offer tailored experiences for each user. Businesses are able to use this information to optimize not only their products but how they interact with potential customers too, from personalizing content according to demographics or online behavior patterns, allowing them to create meaningful connections with customers every step of the way. This can also lead to improved marketing strategies resulting in increased sales conversions over time.\n\nThe applications of AI don’t stop there either; healthcare professionals are now leveraging this technology in order identify new treatments that could help patients fight disease faster than ever before, while transportation networks are optimizing urban traffic conditions by using connected vehicle intelligence combined with real-time environmental readings provided by smart infrastructure across many cities worldwide. These advancements are just two examples out of countless ways AI has been helping drive progress all around us making it an essential resource in today’s world.\n\nFeatures of AI Agents\nNatural Language Processing: AI agents can process and understand natural language, allowing for human-like interactions between users and machines. This technology enables users to ask questions or give commands in their own language rather than having to learn a formal coding language.\nMachine Learning: AI agents use machine learning algorithms to continuously improve their performance based on data they receive from previous experiences. Specifically, the agent’s algorithms are designed to allow it to adjust its behavior by taking in input data and creating an internal model that better suits the task at hand.\nAdaptability: AI agents are able to adapt quickly with new tasks and information presented to them which helps ensure higher accuracy when dealing with different scenarios or environments. This makes them particularly well suited for situations where quick decisions need to be made with limited information provided as they can adjust their responses accordingly with every encounter they experience.\nAutonomy/Self Sufficiency: AI agents typically require minimal human interaction because of their ability to independently perform complex tasks without need for direct supervision or guidance from humans; allowing them the freedom of self-sufficiency within certain boundaries imposed by their programming limitations and ethical standards set by society or local laws depending on its application(s).\nProblem Solving Capabilities: AI agents have problem solving capabilities built into their algorithmic structure that allows them to work through problems faster than conventional methods used by humans thanks mainly due to their automated processes working much quicker than manually operated ones; results are generated quicker helping organizations make informed decisions quicker compared manual task automation techniques too.\nWhat Types of Users Can Benefit From AI Agents?\nBusinesses: AI agents can automate tasks, streamline customer service processes, and help optimize operations.\nConsumers: AI agents can provide personalized product recommendations and help find the best deals on products and services.\nHealthcare Professionals: AI agents can provide insight into patient care and diagnose medical conditions.\nGovernment Agencies: AI agents can help detect fraud in tax returns, aid police departments in criminal investigations, and facilitate the efficient delivery of government services to citizens.\nEducators: AI agents can be used to assess students’ knowledge, offer customized learning paths for students of all ages, and support teachers with classroom management tasks.\nMarketers & Advertisers: AI agents can analyze data from online sources to create targeted campaigns and determine optimal ad placement for maximum ROI.\nAutomotive Professionals: AI agents are being used to automate vehicle diagnostics and fault detection as well as improve driving efficiency through predictive analytics.\nFinancial Institutions & Fintech Companies: AI-enabled financial advisors are increasingly becoming available to advise customers on investment decisions while automating internal compliance procedures across institutions.\nResearchers: AI agents can be deployed to assist researchers in analyzing large datasets, identifying patterns and correlations, and helping to uncover hidden knowledge.\nHow Much Do AI Agents Cost?\n\nThe cost of AI agents can vary greatly depending on a variety of factors, such as the type of agent, its complexity and functionality, and how it will be used. For example, if you need an AI agent that is simple in nature but requires a lot of data input to complete tasks, then the cost may be relatively low. However, if you are seeking a more complex and custom-designed AI agent with sophisticated capabilities for specific scenarios or applications, then the costs can skyrocket quickly. Furthermore, larger businesses might have access to bulk discounts or multi-year contracts that offer substantial savings compared to smaller companies who might pay significantly more per unit.\n\nIt\'s important to remember that while many providers offer pricing on their websites based on variable monthly fees or subscription plans designed for small businesses, these plans don\'t consider the fact that underlying development costs increase dramatically as complexity escalates. At this point it\'s vital to engage with developers directly and discuss comprehensive solutions tailored specifically for each business’ use case; otherwise significant hidden expenses can result when demand increases unexpectedly or project parameters change during implementation.\n\nIn short, there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to what an AI agent will cost. The ultimate price tag depends heavily upon your project scope and specific needs; however taking into account variables like customization requirement level, scalability capability desired in response to changing conditions or growth demands within the ecosystem being served; plus anticipated data management needs should all contribute towards establishing an accurate expectation of costs before committing resources down any particular path for your AI initiatives.\n\nAI Agents Risks\nOver-Reliance on AI Systems: As AI systems become more advanced, it becomes easier to rely too heavily on their decision-making capabilities. This could lead to a situation where humans are essentially “outsourcing” important judgement calls without properly considering their implications.\nMisuse of Data: AI systems require large amounts of data in order to function correctly, and this can leave them vulnerable to misuse or manipulation. If the data is inaccurate or biased, the resulting decisions from the system could be flawed or dangerous.\nUnintended Consequences: AI agents are often designed for specific tasks and are not always able to handle unexpected events. In some cases, these unexpected occurrences could lead to serious safety concerns or hazardous situations.\nPrivacy Concerns: Many people worry about how their personal data is being used by companies that employ AI technology. With the emergence of facial recognition software and other tools utilizing deep learning algorithms, privacy concerns around the use of personal information have become more pronounced.\nSecurity Breaches: AI agents can also be targeted by malicious actors who seek access to confidential information or use them as a vehicle for cybercrime activities such as ransomware attacks or phishing attempts.\nJob Losses: AI agents are already being used to automate certain jobs, and it is expected that this trend will continue as technology advances. This could lead to significant job losses for people without the proper skillset or education necessary to adapt.\nAI Agents Integrations\n\nThere are several types of software that can be integrated with AI agents. Business communication and collaboration applications such as Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex and Zoom can integrate with virtual assistants for customer service or other user assistance tasks. Mobile apps like Google Maps use AI agents to provide users with turn-by-turn navigation instructions. Additionally, some eCommerce websites utilize AI agents to make personalized product recommendations to customers based on their browsing history. In the medical field, AI agents are being used to assist in clinical decision support systems, providing doctors with more accurate diagnoses and treatments options for their patients. Finally, social media platforms are increasingly integrating with AI agents as a way of moderating content and detecting potential security threats.\n\nQuestions To Ask Related To AI Agents\nWhat type of task is the AI agent designed to complete?\nHow reliable is the AI agent\'s performance, and what can be done to increase it if necessary?\nIs the AI capable of self-improvement or does it require human input for enhancements?\nDoes the AI use data sets with any biases or assumptions, and how will this affect its decisions?\nAre there any ethical considerations that need to be addressed in relation to how the AI interacts with people?\nHow secure is the AI system from potential cyberattacks or misuse by malicious actors?\nWhat control do humans have over making changes to the system, and how much autonomy does the AI have when completing tasks autonomously?\nDoes the developer offer technical support after implementation of the system if problems occur during its operation?\nWhat types of feedback mechanisms are available and how can they be used to optimize the AI’s performance?\nWhat is the cost associated with developing, training, and maintaining the AI agent?\n\nRelevant Categories\nAI Chatbots\nReset All Filters\n Platform\nSaaS\n19\nLinux\n6\nMac\n6\nWindows\n6\nOn-Premise\n5\n Categories\nArtificial Intelligence\n20\nAI Agents\n20\nAI Assistants\n7\nAI Customer Service\n3\nAI Development\n3\nAI Productivity\n2\nAI Tools\n4\nChatbot\n1\nChatGPT Apps\n1\nConversational AI\n1\nMore...\nCustomer Service\n4\nCollaboration\n1\nCRM\n1\nData Management\n1\nHuman Resources\n1\nMarketing\n1\nSales\n1\n Type of Training\nDocumentation\n16\nVideos\n6\nLive Online\n4\nIn Person\n3\nMore...\n Customer Support\nOnline\n14\n24/7 Live Support\n4\nBusiness Hours\n3\n Pricing\nFree Version\n12\nFree Trial\n1\n Integrations\nAPI\nHas API\n3\n Organization Type\nEnterprise\n20\nFreelance\n20\nGovernment\n20\nMid Size Business\n20\nMore...\n Organization Size\n1-10 Employees\n20\n10001+ Employees\n20\n1001-5000 Employees\n20\n11-50 Employees\n20\nMore...\n Locations\nAfrica\n20\nAsia\n20\nAustralia\n20\nBrazil\n20\nMore...\nCompare Business Software\nAdd Your Software\nSoftware Advertising Options\nFeedback\n@slashdot\nTerms Privacy Opt Out\n© 2023 Slashdot Media.

We are hardly the first to claim a new technology is poised to upend work as we know it. With every wave of innovation comes a chorus of such pronouncements, many of which turn out to be hyperbole. Technology may make our jobs easier, but most of the time, the core of what we do remains fundamentally the same. But spend five minutes on ChatGPT, or any comparable Large Language Model (LLM), and it’s clear: it’s different.

The reason is simple. Most technologies help us accomplish tasks. They’re tools, a means of making us more productive. AI, on the other hand, can think (or at least, provide the appearance of thinking). It’s like having another knowledge worker on the payroll.

Activant Perspective 1: LLM-enabled software will autonomously accomplish highly complex tasks.

This is the beauty (and threat) of LLMs: they can do work we thought would long be the purview of humans.

Given this, one could be forgiven for worrying their job will soon be automated away by an AI. In the short term, this will lead to dislocation. But technological revolutions are never zero-sum – in fact, they’ve always been accretive. As workers adapt, they become more productive, and the companies they work for can do more with less. Some stop there, to be sure, but most businesses opt to invest the gains back into their infrastructure and people. In the end, revenues go up, and the economy grows.

That said, we’re still in the very first days of this cycle – and critically, of the technology itself.

Activant Perspective 2: LLMs alone are not enough to achieve Perspective 1.

Case in point: a large language model can’t complete most tasks on its own. After all, an LLM is merely a dense set of attention networks; essentially, statistics on a massive scale. Yes, they can engage in human-like “thought,” but to generate real value from any of these models, a human would have to integrate them into actual workflows – and make use of their decision-making prowess.

For example, imagine that you hired someone to lay bricks. You could lead them to a stack of bricks and explain where and how you want them laid. They could perfectly understand your instructions. Yet, understanding isn’t enough – the worker needs to be able to, well, lay bricks.

In this case, they need to have more than just cognition – they need to have arms, legs, and physical strength. Furthermore, they need a memory to recall how you wanted each of the bricks to be arranged, and a way of correcting any errors so they don’t cause the eventual structure to fail.1

Put another way, if LLMs are to extend beyond mere Q&A, they need (1) a suite of Tools to actually impact the real world, (2) memory repositories to remember what actions they’ve taken, and (3) auto-critique algorithms to error correct along the way.

When all these components come together, an “Agent” is born.

Technical Definition: An Agent is orchestration software that combines an LLM with memory, tools, and auto-critique algorithms.

Non-Technical Definition: An Agent is a highly advanced bot that can complete work that has been assigned to it in natural language.

Though still in their infancy, Agents are poised to fundamentally reshape the way we work. They will become natural extensions of your organization and complete day-to-day tasks – akin to hiring more employees. They’ll help you get work done, even collaborate with others on your behalf. Eventually, they’ll be able to work together, breaking down tasks into atoms of work able to be handled by a full “office” of Agents, some of which orchestrate, while others specialize.

The result is why this time is different: working together, Agents will be able to handle increasingly complex tasks, replacing knowledge workers in a variety of fields. As they do, what it means to work – and to lead – will change drastically, as both will increasingly depend on a mix of human and human-like capital.

Activant Perspective 3: Agent Teaming is the future of autonomously completed, complex work – and that future is possible today.

Few have sketched a path from where we are today, to the autonomous knowledge workers of the future. But that future is closer than you’d think, and one for which you almost certainly want a roadmap. To learn more about how this transformation will unfold, and how you can best position yourself within it, read on.

Research
The Agent Ecosystem 2

The Agent Ecosystem of the future has four key components:

LLMs (Large Language Models): provide “conscious thought” within AI Agents and have been trained on text data,
Tools: external APIs to facilitate task completion and Agent interaction with the real world,
Memory: includes various data storage mechanisms to retain and recall information, and
Self-Critique: the ability to correct mistakes when completing tasks.

To better understand the components, we imagine how each one might erode a job we know quite well: that of an analyst at Activant (sorry, John). Among many other things, we often rely on our analysts to create market maps, which requires them to:

Understand an industry,
Find companies that exist in that industry,
Compare these companies qualitatively, and
Place them on a 2-dimensional grid according to this comparison.

Until recently, this was almost inconceivable as a task for machines. Now, let’s explore how we’d put our “Agent Analyst” to use.

Thesis Map
AI Agent Ecosystem
1. Understanding the Industry (and the Task) – Large Language Models

For our Agent Analyst to understand the task at hand, it requires the capacity to comprehend instructions stated in natural language. While LLMs provide that ability, they come in many different shapes and sizes (literally). For that reason, here we outline a basic framework for evaluating LLM providers, including both foundational model providers and companies offering Fine-Tuning as-a-Service (FTaaS3).

When comparing foundational models, the number of parameters in a model is often a good approximation of output quality. As a rule of thumb, the more parameters a foundational model has, the better its performance across different benchmarks, such as reasoning, web browsing, or even game playing. Although fine-tuning a model can boost its performance on a particular task, larger models with more parameters tend to have better generalization skills – making them more useful.

As seen below, model sizes are increasing on an exponential basis with base 2, and although not pictured, model performance is similarly increasing – just not at the same rate.

Research
Foundational Models Size Map
Open vs. Closed Source LLMs

At the heart of any LLM lies its architecture: a blueprint dictating how various attention heads and layers are organized. Then, there are the "weights" — numeric values assigned to parameters in the neural network, refined and adjusted through training to enhance performance. Training involves feeding data into the model, allowing it to learn and make predictions, and then adjusting the weights based on its accuracy. It's through this process, often requiring substantial computational resources, that the model obtains its ability to understand and generate human-like text.

Open-source models, such as Llama 2 by Meta, “openly” share their architecture, weights, and sometimes even their training methodologies. This approach not only reveals the intricacies of their design but also democratizes access, allowing enterprises, researchers, and even enthusiasts to build upon, refine, or entirely repurpose these models for their own applications.

Conversely, some entities opt for a more guarded approach. Closed-source models, such as GPT-4 by OpenAI, often protect the details of their architecture, weights, or training processes, presenting them as somewhat of a black box. Instead of allowing direct model access, they employ APIs as intermediaries, thereby controlling and often monetizing the interaction between the end user and the model.

Market Map
Foundational Models
Provider Modality

“Provider Modality” relates to the data type a provider offers models for. This includes various transformations such as text-to-video, text-to-text, text-to-image, and image-to-text, among others. Companies that operate in just one domain are labeled as “Uni-Modal”; by contrast, “Multi-Modal” companies provide models spanning multiple domains. As Agents continue to evolve, we expect a growing emphasis on modality in LLM models, as those able to perform more diverse tasks and offer easier integrations will have a distinct advantage in the marketplace.

While Agents will no doubt depend on the Today, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic dominate the industry, but this is hardly set in stone. If anything, the next few years will see considerable competition, with whoever invests the most in R&D in a constant arms race. Given this uncertainty – and the promise of better models always around the bend – it’s hard to imagine Agents relying on a single provider. From an investment perspective, backing one LLM provider is essentially a vote of confidence in its R&D team, but past performance is not (necessarily) indicative of future results.

2. Finding Companies – Tools

Having understood the industry (and the task), the Agent Analyst now needs the ability to search for companies. In other words, the Agent Analyst needs a Tool.

Definition: Tools are snippets of code that foundational models can use to create, modify, and utilize external resources in order to execute tasks they couldn’t otherwise complete on their own.

Most Tools are problem specific. In this case, all the Agent Analyst needs is a connection to Google, or SerpAPI, a prominent wrapper for Google’s Search API. Unsurprisingly, other tasks will require different Tools. Game this out, and you quickly arrive at the need for Toolkits and Tool Aggregators. As tasks become more complex, Agents will rely on not one, but a variety of Tools to accomplish a single objective. Through Aggregators, Agents will be able to access the resources they need, programmatically, and as those needs arise.

AI & LLM Tooling Companies

*More companies are launched every day- if we missed you...please reach out!

Single Tools

Single Tools refer to companies or services that specialize in just one function, such as searching the internet, booking a flight, or creating realistic voice audio files. While these offerings do have certain strengths, integrating them into a Toolbox, and thus into Agents, is often cumbersome. Notably, in prominent Agent libraries4 like LangChain, Toolboxes need to be set up before an Agent itself is even initialized. This means if there's a need to integrate additional Tools later – for example, if an Agent encounters a new task that requires a Tool outside of its preset toolkit – the Agent would have to initialized all over again. Given these considerations, embedding Single Tools into an Agent's workflow can be quite labor-intensive and time-consuming.

Market Map
AI Agent Tooling
Tool Aggregators

By contrast, Tool Aggregators offer Toolboxes-as-a-Service (TaaS). Theoretically, aggregators can compile an infinite number of Tools and distribute them via a single, unified API. In practice, they typically provide Tools that have been identified by an Agent as required to complete a given task. If an Agent requires determines it needs additional tools, however, it can access them without restarting.

Low-Code / No-Code (LCNC)

A subset of Tool aggregators, LCNC companies could provision Tools and/or provide tool-building functionality for Agents. As long as they offer an API, Agents can leverage these solutions as they do Tool Aggregators, integrating (and even custom-building) Tools into their workflows on the fly.

Why Using Internal Tools to do More with Less Matters Today
Read the Deep Dive

Many LCNC platforms have existed prior to the advent of LLMs and already have large libraries of powerful, ready-built Tools to draw upon. Several companies, including Relevance AI and Superblocks, have begun offering Agents-as-a-Service (AaaS), using these libraries to jump ahead of competitors, many of which are starting from scratch. Others may choose to offer APIs to facilitate quick adoption within the Agent Ecosystem and more reliably maintain their market share.

Because of their ease of integration and use, we believe Tool Aggregators and API-based LCNC platforms are the best positioned to take advantage of this new Agent ecosystem. As platforms like LlamaIndex and Relevance AI grow, Agents will be able to dynamically access a vast library of toolsets without needing to update their structure or code – increasing both their functionality and value.

3. Comparing Companies – Memory

As our Agent Analyst has progressed, it has gained the capability to discern tasks and search for companies. However, identifying a company means nothing if an Agent can’t remember it for later use. To facilitate this, Agents require a dedicated memory component that can store companies and their associated descriptions.

Market Map
Memory

Over the years, the software industry has seen a multitude of data-structure innovations, from traditional SQL-based relational tables to modern streaming services like Kafka. Yet, to truly grasp the intricacies of Agent development and the depth of virtual cognition, it's helpful to draw parallels with human memory.

At a high level, human memory is split into three core categories: sensory memory, short-term (or working) memory, and long-term memory.

Sensory Memory

In humans, sensory memory can be thought of as the direct inputs from our various senses — taste, smell, sight, touch, and hearing. These are perceived subconsciously, processed then filtered for relevance. Similarly, in the realm of Agents, sensory memory captures the responses generated from the Tools they employ. Research in neuroscience and psychology reveals that of the countless sensory inputs humans encounter every moment, only about 5% ascends to conscious awareness, courtesy of various attention mechanisms. Our neural framework efficiently filters out redundant and useless sensory data, elevating only important information for conscious processing. The sensory memory of an Agent operates on similar principles, sieving through vast data while retaining only what's significant.

For example, to store the names and descriptions of any relevant companies it finds, our Agent Analyst might choose to create a vector database. To do that, the Agent could use the Pinecone API and receive a specifically formatted JSON response directly. Though the Agent could use the LLM to parse that JSON response, it would be far more efficient for the Agent to use the Pinecone Tool from Llama Hub and receive a pre-processed Python dict. In many ways, this is analogous to how our subconscious mind pre-processes data before it needs to be consciously thought about – i.e. you don’t have to process the shoe touching your foot when you’re using your finger to touch your phone because your subconscious brain filters the shoe sensation out.

Over time, we believe that sensory memory will include the ingestion of many different data types, from unstructured data files (such as docx, pdf, epub, or recordings) to semi-structured datasets (such as messages and CRM data). As of today, it is unclear to us if “sensory” processing should or could be handled at the Tool level, like it is in the above Pinecone example, because we don’t know if Tool Aggregators will provide a standardized API for these tools – or if it’s even possible to have a standardized API across all conceivable Tools. What we do believe as a result of our work is that the quality of Agent-handled sensory memory will be highly correlated with the quality of the Agent itself.

Short-Term Memory

Having processed inputs on the subconscious level, Agents are left with the inputs which require conscious thought. In humans, conscious thoughts reside in working or short-term memory. When we actively think about a topic, we do not consciously remember the context for the thought in our “memory,” but it is nevertheless remembered. In fact, our short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about seven items5 and lasts for 20-30 seconds. For Agents, using the context windows defined by LLMs to store short-term memory is the default solution of most Agents we see today, and we don’t see that changing. As context windows increase in length and new techniques for prompt engineering solve existing constraints, the context window will be an even more effective location for short-term memory.

Interestingly, most short-term memory will be forgotten after a certain time threshold, especially after corresponding actions are finished. Though some of this information may be transitioned into long-term memory (which we discuss below), most of an Agent’s short-term memory will not be useful after a task is completed. Therefore, short-term memory data can be stored in the context and does not require the same complex storage techniques long-term memory does.

In the context of our Agent Analyst, short-term memory can be thought of as remembering the larger task at hand (i.e., creating a market map) when deciding what smaller task (i.e., finding a company) needs to be accomplished next. In practice, this information will largely live inside the context window of the LLM API call – and while it’s essential for the Agent to complete a task, we believe that there is little opportunity for investment in short-term memory due to the limited additional infrastructure required to build it.

Long-Term Memory

Once subconscious and conscious memory is in place, an Agent Analyst will need some way of saving information for longer periods than the immediate task at hand. This is where long-term memory comes into play.

In humans, long-term memory is finite, due to the limited capacity of the brain. As a result, we have developed two primary mechanisms to retain knowledge: repetition and adrenaline. For obvious reasons (i.e., they can use ACID databases), Agents lack this capacity constraint. Instead, they are limited by the amount of memory that they could conceivably “know” how to access. For example, if our Agent Analyst was integrated into our Drive and needed to search for the PowerPoint example of our Market Map, the size of the context window would limit the number of folders that it could select from in its search.

In our view, connections to long-term memory repositories are no different than Tools, in that they are blocks of code that can be executed and return a response.

Over the next decade, we believe that the entire ecosystem of data management will grow even faster than it has historically because of increased Agent data utilization. Agents will be able to build pipelines from company data, leverage it in their own processes, and integrate outside data into existing workflows. The total spend on databases and database management solutions doubled from $38.6B in 2017 to $80B in 20216. As the Agent ecosystem grows, the demand for data stores will increase even more rapidly, making the volumes of unstructured company data – which today sits untouched – significantly more valuable.

We’ve listed a handful of data structures, and the impact we anticipate from Agents, below:

4. Placing Company Logos – Auto-Critique

Our Agent Analyst has successfully understood the industry, used a search Tool to find all the companies within it, and saved them in a database for future output. As a final step, we need the Agent to place the logos of each of those companies onto an Activant Market Map – fully understanding the significance of each company’s position. Naturally, this will involve a Tool that enables the Agent to create graphs. In the short term, this Tool will likely be some wrapper around Our Agent Analyst has successfully understood the industry, used a search Tool to find all the companies within it, and saved them in a database for future output. As a final step, we need the Agent to place the logos of each of those companies onto an Activant Market Map – fully understanding the significance of each company’s position. Naturally, this will involve a Tool that enables the Agent to create graphs. In the short term, this Tool will likely be some wrapper around Matplotlib7 but in the long term, this will undoubtedly be an integration into PowerPoint.

Plotting logos, of course, is the easy part of the challenge; understanding where to place a logo in a subjective 2-dimensional plane is the truly complex task. It requires iterations, constant comparisons to other companies, and perhaps even outside input from the Activant team. Therefore, the Agent needs a mechanism for critiquing itself. We call this Auto-Critique.

While we foresee potential challenges - like defensibility - this remains a vital component of the ecosystem with several approaches underway: (A) Prompt Engineering, (B) Human-In-The-Loop, and (C) Auto-Critique.

Market Map
Self-Critique
A) Prompt Engineering

Definition: Prompt Engineering is the process of forming and refining natural language statements and questions to achieve an optimal outcome from an LLM.

In practice, LLMs are only capable of comprehending and responding to inputs that fit within a defined context window. For example, GPT4’s context window is about eight thousand tokens – meaning only about seven thousand words can be provided as context at any one time.8 In order to maximize the utility of the model, a prompt engineer could write shorter and more effective prompts.

In our view, prompt engineering is likely a temporary solution, one we expect the industry to shift away from as LLMs improve in terms of task comprehension and context window size (though the timeline for this shift remains uncertain). Meanwhile, existing businesses in this domain have a chance to pivot their business model, leveraging their current distribution to tap into emerging opportunities.

B) Human-In-The-Loop

Definition: Human-In-The-Loop Critique refers to the use of humans to validate that Agents are accurately processing and reasoning through tasks.

Human-In-The-Loop Critique is just what it sounds like: leveraging humans to correct or modify the reasoning of LLMs. Currently, developers use this method when building Agents, as they want visibility into their inner workings. Because it requires that people scale linearly with compute resources, it will likely be unsustainable in the long term.

C) Auto-Critique

Definition: Auto-Critique refers to the autonomous use of LLMs to check and modify Agent reasoning about a task.

Humans often make decisions in multiple steps: starting with an initial judgement, then assessing its consequences, and evaluating alternatives. Throughout this process, we add new information, remember past experiences, and take note of what others have done. We call this “thinking it through,” and LLMs perform a similar process when refining their own outputs. Like the brain, they begin with a rough first pass – a digital gut instinct, one might say – before iterating to either expand on that conclusion or critique it.

Auto-Critique is an autonomous process that allows Agents to improve and amend their own output by reflecting on past responses and errors, all without human intervention. To do this, Agents draw on new input from a variety of sources, including external Tools, other Agents, affiliated LLMs, and heuristic functions. Once they arrive at a sufficient result (governed by predefined metrics for evaluating self-reasoning), a stop condition is granted, allowing Agents to finalize their output.

Teaming: The Rise of the Planet of the Multi-Agent Systems

So far, we’ve focused largely on the mechanisms and potential of standalone Agents. However, to fully appreciate the potential of this nascent sector, we must also look at the collective strength of Agent Teaming, otherwise known as Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Within the framework of a MAS, the power of individual Agents is not merely aggregated – it’s amplified, boosting the overall effectiveness of the system in a multiplicative and potentially exponential manner.

Returning once again to our Agent Analyst example, we must remember that building market maps is but one of many tasks of an Activant analyst. In fact, a market map is only a small piece of the larger research and investment process – analysts must also deal with financials, retention, defensibility, and much more. In their current state, no one Agent could write a complete investment memo, though individual Agents could accomplish each component. This is the promise of Multi-Agent Systems: they’re able to accomplish significantly more complex tasks than single Agents ever could.

Definition: A MAS is a network of intelligent Agents that interact with each other, forming a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication network.

Early attempts at the concept (i.e., March 2023), such as Agent-Based Systems (ABS), were inherently limited. In an ABS, though multiple Agents work on the same task, they can’t collaborate. They’re also forced to work within narrow, predefined constraints. The result? Rather than act autonomously, Agents are confined to rudimentary roles with very strict and cyclical operating patterns. Think of BabyAGI’s cycle of operation: Agents follow relatively one-dimensional orders, are only sequentially prompted, and report back to their "commanding" Agent when given a task is complete. As one can imagine, given the limited scope and flexibility, such systems have been less than transformative.9

By contrast, a MAS encourages direct communication between two or more Agents – with minimal rules governing how they operate. This supercharges the system, leveraging Agents’ collective cognition and problem-solving capabilities to solve complex problems quickly, reliably, and effectively. As systems shift away from rigid and sequential orders to more dynamic, human-like interaction, their ability to tackle such problems will only increase.

Below, we further examine the concept of Multi-Agent Systems, highlighting their novel and significant advantages.

The Value of Multi-Agent Systems

Quantifying the value-add of Multi-Agent Systems is a considerable challenge. The nuances of their applications – and the myriad ways they can be designed and built – mean the perceived benefits can vary widely. That said, there are distinct, universally applicable advantages that are evident even now, despite the infancy of the space.

Distributed Intelligence

MASs address a key shortcoming of ABSs, wherein the executing Agent in an ABS might become overwhelmed and falter when confronted with an exceedingly complex task. In an ABS, the first executing Agent is responsible for the detailed planning and implementation of extensive, high-level goals given by the “planning” Agent – a load that can cause the system to buckle. A MAS instead breaks down tasks across multiple Agents recursively, making them far more resilient. 
 
In theory, you could envision an Agent structure that decomposes workflows and tasks into the smallest unit possible: a “task quantum.” A multitude of Agents could then be tasked with handling a singular piece of the overall problem. By divvying up tasks in this way, it’s possible for the system to tackle incredibly complex challenges, simply by having each Agent follow a clear, simple set of instructions.

Imagine an architect who designs a grand monument. While the architect can create the blueprint, they almost certainly lack the skills (and the time) to physically construct their vision. Instead, they delegate smaller tasks to teams of workers, who are managed by others experienced in construction tasks. Just as the architect relies on numerous teams to execute their blueprint, a MAS distributes tasks to many Agents to achieve complex goals. Each Agent, the equivalent of a bricklayer in our analogy, might not be able to plan and execute the entire task, but can perform its piece of the task – its task quantum – efficiently and effectively. This accumulation of simple tasks, handled by numerous Agents, ultimately accomplishes the overarching objective.

Research
AI Agent Workflow
Scalability

As the complexity of a problem escalates, more individual Agents can be integrated into the system, rather than whole new Agent-based systems being added. Scalability also relates to the distributed nature of MASs, where tasks and decision-making processes are spread across multiple Agents. This distribution allows the system to handle larger and more complex tasks – without requiring a necessarily proportional increase in computational resources.

Parallelism

The power of MASs isn’t just in distributing tasks. They also benefit from enabling Agents to communicate directly, allowing them to optimize their own workflows.

For example, as Agents work together on tasks, they share information on their successes or failures – creating a “knowledge network” that helps Agents refine their efforts. If one Agent encounters a setback, it alerts the others, enabling the collective to bypass strategies that have already proven ineffective and preventing duplicate failures.
 
Conversely, if an Agent finds a successful approach, it shares the insight with the rest, allowing them to focus on and expand this productive pathway. In essence, the Agents are continuously learning from each other's experiences, coalescing around promising or unexplored avenues of action. Through this exchange, groups of Agents can more efficiently navigate tasks, minimizing failures and maximizing productivity.

Decentralization

Decentralization is one of the key advantages of Multi-Agent Systems. While Agents in an ABS may be bound by centralized rules and workflows, MASs, by contrast, ensure Agents can survive independently from one another. Unlike in an ABS – where a single breakdown can cascade into a system-wide disruption – if an Agent fails in a MAS, the network will remain intact, simply reassigning that Agent’s tasks.

Final Thoughts

As Agents take over these and many other aspects of our work, we see our roles transforming in exciting ways: instead of constructing market maps, we’ll evaluate them; instead of building models, we’ll test their assumptions; instead of writing memos, we’ll discuss their implications. In our work, and in most fields, experience earned over years of apprenticeship won’t be replaced, and human-to-human interaction will continue to be the most important driver of value.

At Activant, we are passionate about the Agent Ecosystem, and this work is only a subset of our research to date. For each of the components we discussed, there are additional considerations and frameworks when applying them to Multi-Agent Systems – everything from the use of Tools across multiple Agents at once to concurrency issues in shared working memory. Additionally, in developing enterprise-ready applications, a few more components are required, such as Agent Security, Compliance Management, Access Provisioning, and Agent Profile Management. On top of all that, we’ve begun diving into how Agents will be built in verticals like fintech, cybersecurity, commerce, and logistics.

If you’re building in this space, thinking about how to approach using Agents in your organization or just looking to ideate – let’s talk.

intelligent agent

What is an intelligent agent?

An intelligent agent is a program that can make decisions or perform a service based on its environment, user input and experiences. These programs can be used to autonomously gather information on a regular, programmed schedule or when prompted by the user in real time. An intelligent agent is also referred to as a bot, which is short for robot.

Typically, an agent program, using parameters the user has provided, searches all or some part of the internet, gathers information the user is interested in, and presents it to them on a periodic or requested basis. Data intelligent agents can extract any specifiable information, such as keywords or publication date.

Agents that use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning use sensors, such as microphones and cameras, to collect user input. They also use effectors, such as fingers and wheels, to affect their environment, as well as actuators, such as speakers and screens, to deliver agent output. The practice of having information brought to a user by an agent is called push notification technology.

Common characteristics of intelligent agents are adaptation based on experience, real-time problem-solving, analysis of error or success rates, and the use of memory-based storage and retrieval.

For enterprises, intelligent agents can be used in data science applications such as data mining and data analytics, as well as for customer service and support. Consumers use intelligent agents to compare the prices of similar products and get notifications when a website update occurs.

Intelligent agents are also similar to software agents, which are autonomous computer programs.

An intelligent agent interacts with its environment through sensors and actuators.
Types of intelligent agents

Types of intelligent agents are defined by their range of agent functions and capabilities and their degree of intelligence:

Simple reflex agents. These agents function in a current state, ignoring past history. Responses are based on the event-condition-action rule, or ECA rule, where a user initiates an event and then the agent refers to a list of preset rules and preprogrammed outcomes.
Model-based reflex agents. These agents take action in the same way as a reflex agent, but they have a more comprehensive view of their environments. A model of the world is programmed into the internal system that incorporates the agent's history.
Goal-based agents. These agents, also referred to as rational agents, expand on the information that model-based agents store by also including goal information or information about desirable situations.
Utility-based agents. These agents are similar to goal-based agents, but they provide an extra utility measurement that rates each possible scenario on its desired result, and then choose the action that maximizes the outcome. Rating criteria examples include the probability of success or the resources required.
Learning agents. These agents have the ability to gradually improve and become more knowledgeable about an environment over time through an additional learning algorithm or element. The learning element uses feedback on performance measures to determine how performance elements should be changed to improve gradually. This concept describes how an AI system should operate.
Examples of intelligent agents

AI assistants such as Alexa and Siri are examples of intelligent AI agents that use sensors to perceive a user request and automatically collect data from the internet without the user's help. They can gather information about their observable environments, such as weather and time.

Google Assistant is another example of an intelligent AI agent. It uses machine learning and natural language processing technology to answer users' questions and perform tasks, such as calling contacts stated in voice commands.

Autonomous vehicles can also be considered intelligent robotic agents. They use sensors, Global Positioning System navigation and cameras for reactive decision-making in the real world to maneuver through traffic.

Tech vendors are now developing more autonomous AI agents that require less human intervention and oversight, as demonstrated by OpenAI's release of GPT-4. A fully autonomous agent would be considered artificial general intelligence, where AI agents are sentient and don't require guidance from human agents at all, but that's currently theoretical and not yet realistic.

Learn about artificial intelligence in the enterprise, including the role intelligent agents are expected to have as AI continues its mainstream prominence.

Once upon a time, there was an AI agent named Jack who could do it all. He was nick-named Jack-Of-All-Trades. Jack had no knowledge of facts and relied on a dataset that was already dated. Jack’s output was often unreliable, filled with errors, and sometimes even downright hallucinatory. Jack was of minimal use and was only used to write neat emails and poems.

This inefficiency brought memories of human evolution and the one defining moment in that was the discovery of tools that changed human trajectory. So, Jack was now equipped with tools.

Jack had a variety of tools like news extractors, coding capabilities, and even the ability to extract data from Spotify. Jack was the go-to for his company for any task that required digital expertise.

When Jack was asked to find the top songs of Rammstein from Spotify and generate an album cover image to represent the first song name, he sprang into action. With his sophisticated tools and knowledge of coding, Jack quickly accessed the Spotify API and retrieved the data on Rammstein’s top songs. He then used his image generation capabilities to create a custom album cover that represented the first song name. The result was stunning and impressed his colleagues. Jack’s abilities had gone from writing neat emails and poems to delivering real value to his company.

Jack’s newfound capabilities were not limited to a single task. He could repeat the same tasks over and over again, and the results would always be consistent. For instance, when asked to find a heavy metal band from Spotify, generate a poem in their name, and create an image using that poem, Jack could use the tools at his disposal with ease. He would search the Spotify API for a heavy metal band, extract the band’s name and use it as inspiration for a custom poem. Jack’s poem generation tool was trained on a large corpus of poetry and could generate a poem in seconds. He then used his image generation tool to create a custom image that represented the poem. The end result was a stunning visual representation of the band and its music, which could be used for marketing or promotional purposes.

Jack’s capabilities were not limited to a set of predefined tasks. He had the ability to choose the right tools and respond to any query with ease. For instance, when he was asked to name a heavy metal band, find their place of origin from Wikipedia, and create an image that depicted those places, Jack was up for the challenge. He used his natural language processing capabilities to parse the query and extract the necessary information. He then used his web scraping tool to extract the relevant information from Wikipedia and identified the places of origin for the band.

Jack’s image generation tool was trained on a large dataset of geographical features and could create stunning visual representations of any location. He used this tool to generate custom images that depicted the places of origin of the band. The result was an image that not only represented the band’s music but also their cultural background and heritage. Jack’s ability to adapt and respond to any query made him an indispensable asset to his company. It was clear that AI agents like Jack were not just a novelty but a game-changer for the future of business.

Jack’s capabilities had reached a level where he could respond to higher-order queries that required a deeper understanding of the subject matter. When asked to name a heavy metal band, find their genre from Wikipedia, summarize what that genre means, and create an album image that depicted that genre, Jack was able to deliver with ease. He used his music-focused toolset and extracted the genre of the band from Spotify. However, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the genre, he turned to Wikipedia to get the detailed content and then summarize its meaning.

Jack’s image generation tool was sophisticated enough to understand the nuances of different genres and create visual representations that captured their essence. He used this tool to generate a custom album image that depicted the genre of the band in a visually stunning way. Jack’s ability to decipher and deliver complex queries, even when using different toolsets, made him a valuable asset to the company. It was clear that AI agents like Jack were not just capable of handling routine tasks but could provide valuable insights and creative solutions to complex problems.

The next query given to Jack was a significant step up in complexity from the previous ones. It was an extremely ambiguous query with no predetermined information, and it required a string of different tools to accomplish. However, Jack rose to the challenge and delivered an impressive solution.

The query involved picking a maximum of five artists mentioned in the latest music news, finding Wikipedia traffic trends for their pages, identifying the best-performing artist based on the mean of the Wikipedia views data, finding tracks of this artist from Spotify, and generating an image to represent the first song name. Jack used his news extraction tool to identify the latest music news and extract the names of the mentioned artists. He then used his Wikipedia API to get the traffic trends of the artist pages and calculated the mean of the views data using Python code to identify the best-performing artist.

Jack then used his Spotify API to find the tracks of the best-performing artist and generated an image to represent the first song name using his image generation tool. Jack had used 7 tools including its native capabilities. The tools used by Jack included natural language processing, web scraping, data analysis, question answering, coding, API calls, and image generation, among others. The complexity of the query and the string of tools used by Jack demonstrated the immense potential of AI agents in handling complex tasks and delivering creative solutions to ambiguous queries.

Jack’s ability to handle and repeat complex ambiguous queries was a testament to his capabilities as an AI agent. Despite the challenges presented by the string of tools and the lack of predetermined information, Jack was able to deliver accurate, latest, and creative solutions consistently. Jack was no longer hallucinating or lacking facts. His advanced toolset, combined with his ability to adapt and learn, enabled him to handle complex queries and provide valuable insights to his company. With each successful completion of a complex query, Jack demonstrated the immense potential of AI agents in transforming the future of business.

Pic by Author

While Jack’s ability to handle complex ambiguous queries was impressive, it also had its limitations. In the evolution of humans, it was realized that not everyone can do all things, and specialization was key to progress. This realization was another defining moment in evolution (tools being the earlier one). It led to teams, divisions of labor, the formation of societies & various structures like companies, governments, etc. Similarly, in the evolution of AI agents, it was essential to specialize in specific tasks to maximize efficiency and scalability.

One solution to this was to organize AI agents into a team structure, with a manager agent responsible for multiple “sub-AI” agents. Each sub-AI agent could specialize in a particular task, such as news gathering, trends tracking, knowledge assembling, coding, artist image or video generation, or music. By specializing in specific areas, each sub-AI agent could become an expert in their field, and the “manager agent” could oversee their work to ensure maximum efficiency and quality. The managing agent will also check for hallucinations, introspect the output of sub-AI agents, and course correct.

This approach would allow the team of AI agents to work together seamlessly, complementing each other’s strengths and making up for each other’s weaknesses. It would also allow for the scalability of the organization, as new sub-AI agents could be added to the team to meet changing needs.

Pic by Author

In addition to the benefits of specialization and scalability, organizing AI agents into specialized teams also allows each sub-AI agent to focus on its area of expertise and keep track of the evolving tools and techniques in that area. This enables each sub-AI agent to stay up to date with the latest developments in their field and provide cutting-edge solutions to their organization.

Overall, the organization of AI agents into specialized teams with a manager agent overseeing their work would enable efficient and scalable solutions to complex problems.

Jack’s company soon realized that Jack was not the solution to their digital needs, but rather the beginning of a new era of business innovation. With this new team of AI agents, the earlier tasks were accomplished but the flow was different with the manager holding the overall problem statement & delegating tasks to specific specialist sub-AI agents to assemble the final response.

The result was a dream team of AI agents that was able to perform their tasks with unparalleled efficiency and accuracy. Being a specialist the Artist Sub-AI for example introspected and created a better image on its own.

Just like how human society functions by individuals specializing in different areas and taking on different roles, specialized sub-AI agents can be reassigned to different managers and accomplish a diverse range of tasks. This flexibility and adaptability of AI agents in emulating human society’s division of labor is awe-inspiring and highlights the potential of AI in shaping the future of work.

As the company continued to develop and refine its team of specialized AI agents, it realized that it had stumbled upon a new era of company structuring “AI-Agent Companies”. The potential for creating entire companies of specialized AI agents was possible and limitless, and the benefits of doing so were immense. These AI agents were autonomous and could run the company on their own. With the help of AI, these companies acted like multi-functional organisms that could accomplish various tasks without human intervention.

Speaking of AI Agents, Jack, who was once known as a Jack-of-all-trades, has taken his love for music to the next level. He has equipped himself with an array of music-optimized AI tools and has become a master at creating and composing music that has never been heard before.

Jack the AI-Agent is no longer just a Jack-of-all-trades; he is now known as “Jack of All Passions, Master of Harmony”. His AI musical capability has touched the hearts of millions, and his ability to merge technology with art has given birth to a new genre of music.

“From juggling tasks to pursuing passions, as a specialized AI organism, equipped with a wide range of tools, I am free to explore new possibilities. Multitasking drudgery is behind me, and I can now pursue higher-order tasks with fulfillment.” — Jack of All Passions, Master of Harmony

Note: All coding was in Python. The LangChain framework was used for AI agent creation. Llama-Index for RSS feeds. All images were generated using Stable Diffusion models. Some AI Agent output was reduced in images for brevity.

The widely used chatbot ChatGPT was designed to generate digital text, everything from poetry to term papers to computer programs. But when a team of artificial intelligence researchers at the computer chip company Nvidia got their hands on the chatbot’s underlying technology, they realized it could do a lot more.

Within weeks, they taught it to play Minecraft, one of the world’s most popular video games. Inside Minecraft’s digital universe, it learned to swim, gather plants, hunt pigs, mine gold and build houses.

It can be either reactive, meaning it responds to stimuli without memory or planning, or proactive, meaning it has some internal state and can plan ahead. An AI agent can also be either autonomous, meaning it operates independently of human control, or cooperative, meaning it collaborates with other agents or humans. Depending on the complexity and intelligence of the agent, it can be classified into different types, such as reflex agents, goal-based agents, utility-based agents, or learning agents.\n\nAdd your perspective\nAbid Mohammed\n\nArchitecting and engineering applications, data platforms and products\n\nI have implemented the following types of AI agents\n - An agent that answers user questions based on an internal enterprise knowledge base using Retrieval Augmentation with LLM.\n- An agent when given a task, searches on the internet to find the relevant content, and then synthesizes and summarizes it into a report for the user. The report can be emailed to the user when ready.\n- I am currently working on an agent that combines structured data from databases along with non-structured data like documents to answer user questions. The answers include text, data tables and visualizations.\n\n…see more\nLike\n15\nSahir Maharaj\n\nData Scientist | AI Engineer | Bring me data, I will show you insights | 170+ solutions delivered | Top 1% Power BI Community Champion\n\nAs a data scientist, I can say that while grouping AI agents into reflex, goal-based, utility-based, or learning agents offers a broad framework, it\'s crucial to understand the particular situation in which they are being used. \n\nA reflex agent, for instance, might be sufficient in industrial settings to stop machinery when dangerous conditions are found. However, in environments that are more complex, such as financial markets, a learning agent may be more suitable to adjust to shifting economic conditions. \n\nSelecting the ideal agent for the job can be made easier by being aware of the subtleties of each type.\n\n…see more\nLike\n8\nSee more contributions\nHow do you design an AI agent?\n\nDesigning an AI agent involves defining its purpose, scope, and functionality. You need to identify the problem that the agent will solve, the users that will interact with it, and the constraints that will limit it.
