We put The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch to the test after receiving a complimentary sample from the brand. Keep reading for our full product review. 

Editor’s Note: We reviewed this article on September 24, 2023. As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.

Period, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren't blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month. 

Lucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I'll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.

Keep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.

COSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH

BEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types

KEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid

PRICE: $19

ABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.

About My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts

My skin can be unpredictable. But, as I've gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.  

Ingredients: One key, familiar ingredient 

The tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.

The Feel: Like a bandage

You can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Packaging: Easy to store

The 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish

I placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.

Even with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn't budge overnight.

If you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn't expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn't gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don't believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Value: Worth it

Was this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

Similar Products: You've got options 

squish. Flower Power Acne Patches ($14): This pack of 20 floral hydrocolloid pimple patches to help zap blemishes overnight and let's face it, they're pretty darn cute. Pimple, but make them pretty. 

Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Variety Pack ($7): These 36 count medical-grade, chemical-free, allergy-tested patches stay put no matter how much you toss and turn throughout the night. 

Final Verdict

If you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won't regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.

Esp the one that hurt....
For me, i esp destroy them, y'know the thing and it left me with small scars everywhere around my chin..usually it appears there.
I don't usually have this acne but i guess wearing mask all the time makes it this way....

I once got a lot of acne around the end of my school year on my cheeks and my temples despite regularly washing my face everday (facewash and moisturizer), and it was the largest breakout I've ever had. It stayed for about three months until I saw this tiktok saying Vaseline actually works really well. Then I did a quick search on google and google said it worked (which isnt really a very reliable ig, but I didnt really care), so I ended up trying it. It worked after two weeks of putting Vaseline on my face after using my facewash every night, and worked so fast that the results were obvious. I dont think any other factors were the cause of my rapidly reduced acne because my routine still stayed the same. So, you can try that i guess. Also make sure to keep yourself hydrated and moisturized.

my mum buys some facewash and pimple cream from some beautician she knows and I use it
my pimples do not improve significantly though, it mostly depends on my hormone level and whether it's nearing that time of the month
another reason I have acne is because I lie on one side of the bed

I wash my face 2 times a day because my face gets fairly oily
and when those under skin acne pop up I slather a thick layer of pimple cream
occasionally when I'm free I squeeze them with tissues though I know it makes them scar

I'm experimenting with some facewashes rn to see what helps

also... I heard somewhere that passing motion helps

I bought cleansers acne patches to help out since I've been breaking out badly. I sweat a lot and the masks certainly don't help, especially since I'm half dead and a sweaty mess by the time I reach my class.

Although I still have acne it's not as bad as before. What helped me out was washing my face day and night and applying moisturizer. Moisturizer really helps out.

Definitely try Curology or buy the Ordinary products. I've tried both and they both work well. I currently use a the Ordinary face mask and common drug store moisturizer and cleansers, and there's been a noticeable difference. I also saw someone mention vaseline, but I suggest you be careful with that since it can clog your pores.

Isn't popping them making it worse?


I'm sure there's some medicine or therapy for it...if it's too big see doctor they'd clean it out properly.

Usual causes of acne are stress, bad hygiene and/or diet. Try to change your beddings regularly too. If changing these things for the better still don't help, then you could only blame your parents for your genetics. Also don't expect immediate results, be patient and be consistent.

I didn't have those, just pimples that don't leave scars. I always popped them despite being said it's better to leave them, just make sure it's clean afterwards with alchocol.
I stopped eating unhealthy food that causes pimples as much as I can, things like milk chocolate(I prefer dark one anyway), ketchup and other similary industrially over processed foods.
Also found Neutrogena clear and defend rapid gel. Instead of waiting for days until the white head appears, you can pop a pimple in a single day, then just wipe with alchocol which also dries and reduces it.

Ewww Backne. Lmao


Usual causes of acne are stress, bad hygiene and/or diet. Try to change your beddings regularly too. If changing these things for the better still don't help, then you could only blame your parents for your genetics. Also don't expect immediate results, be patient and be consistent.
yeah guess so, what's wrong with backne tho? not like it's controllable

I didn't have those, just pimples that don't leave scars. I always popped them despite being said it's better to leave them, just make sure it's clean afterwards with alchocol.
I stopped eating unhealthy food that causes pimples as much as I can, things like milk chocolate(I prefer dark one anyway), ketchup and other similary industrially over processed foods.
Also found Neutrogena clear and defend rapid gel. Instead of waiting for days until the white head appears, you can pop a pimple in a single day, then just wipe with alchocol which also dries and reduces it.
ok! got it! thanks!!!

Mine flare up with caffeine intake, so I try to refrain from as many carbonated drinks and coffee, as much as possible. Dunno if it works for you.
Also, try not to let sweat dry on your face, and wash frequently, since acne mostly is due to sweat clogging up the pores leading to sebum accumulation

For me, i esp destroy them, y'know the thing and it left me with small scars everywhere around my chin..usually it appears there.
I don't usually have this acne but i guess wearing mask all the time makes it this way....
I usually consult with a dermatologist. But for emergency, i use bandaids/acne patches to cover the most offending spot. It's quite effective for me, since the patch keep my hands away, conceal the redness, while also suck the liquid inside those acnes out without the need to pop them and thus, reduce the swelling. But, i need to change it several times a day. After 3-4 days of acne patches, the swelling part usually gonna get pretty tame.
But again, what work for me might not work for you.
(Juust a disclaimer, I'm no doctor and this is not a medical advice )

don't have any, if I do get it I guess I just ignore it. Don't think too much about it, but if it's severe go to the derma. My skin used to be crystal clear that I used to get regularly get compliments for it, but a year ago, it started acting up. It's okay now, but I don't think it's as clear as it used to be. Oh well

This is what I do... really helps control
1. Drinking a lot of water
2. Drinking healthy tea (like chrysanthemum tea, 涼茶) / avoid unhealthy foods (actually tbh I don't really do this right now cause I'm a little piggy. But it helps if you have will power to change eating habits.)
3. Change pillowcase everyday + wash blanket cover / sheets once a week
4. Consistent skin care routine. Right now I am using oil cleanser + regular foam cleanser, I'm From Mugwort set, and cosrx AHA and BHA serums.

I once got a lot of acne around the end of my school year on my cheeks and my temples despite regularly washing my face everday (facewash and moisturizer), and it was the largest breakout I've ever had. It stayed for about three months until I saw this tiktok saying Vaseline actually works really well. Then I did a quick search on google and google said it worked (which isnt really a very reliable ig, but I didnt really care), so I ended up trying it. It worked after two weeks of putting Vaseline on my face after using my facewash every night, and worked so fast that the results were obvious. I dont think any other factors were the cause of my rapidly reduced acne because my routine still stayed the same. So, you can try that i guess. Also make sure to keep yourself hydrated and moisturized.

my mum buys some facewash and pimple cream from some beautician she knows and I use it
my pimples do not improve significantly though, it mostly depends on my hormone level and whether it's nearing that time of the month
another reason I have acne is because I lie on one side of the bed

I wash my face 2 times a day because my face gets fairly oily
and when those under skin acne pop up I slather a thick layer of pimple cream
occasionally when I'm free I squeeze them with tissues though I know it makes them scar

I'm experimenting with some facewashes rn to see what helps

also... I heard somewhere that passing motion helps

I also saw someone mention vaseline, but I suggest you be careful with that since it can clog your pores.

Isn't popping them making it worse?


I'm sure there's some medicine or therapy for it...if it's too big see doctor they'd clean it out properly.

Isn't popping them making it worse?


I'm sure there's some medicine or therapy for it...if it's too big see doctor they'd clean it out properly.

Usual causes of acne are stress, bad hygiene and/or diet. Try to change your beddings regularly too. If changing these things for the better still don't help, then you could only blame your parents for your genetics. Also don't expect immediate results, be patient and be consistent.

I didn't have those, just pimples that don't leave scars. I always popped them despite being said it's better to leave them, just make sure it's clean afterwards with alchocol.
I stopped eating unhealthy food that causes pimples as much as I can, things like milk chocolate(I prefer dark one anyway), ketchup and other similary industrially over processed foods.
Also found Neutrogena clear and defend rapid gel. Instead of waiting for days until the white head appears, you can pop a pimple in a single day, then just wipe with alchocol which also dries and reduces it.

I once got a lot of acne around the end of my school year on my cheeks and my temples despite regularly washing my face everday (facewash and moisturizer), and it was the largest breakout I've ever had. It stayed for about three months until I saw this tiktok saying Vaseline actually works really well. Then I did a quick search on google and google said it worked (which isnt really a very reliable ig, but I didnt really care), so I ended up trying it. It worked after two weeks of putting Vaseline on my face after using my facewash every night, and worked so fast that the results were obvious. I dont think any other factors were the cause of my rapidly reduced acne because my routine still stayed the same. So, you can try that i guess. Also make sure to keep yourself hydrated and moisturized.
Vaseline as the one u put on ur skin?

my mum buys some facewash and pimple cream from some beautician she knows and I use it
my pimples do not improve significantly though, it mostly depends on my hormone level and whether it's nearing that time of the month
another reason I have acne is because I lie on one side of the bed

I wash my face 2 times a day because my face gets fairly oily
and when those under skin acne pop up I slather a thick layer of pimple cream
occasionally when I'm free I squeeze them with tissues though I know it makes them scar

I'm experimenting with some facewashes rn to see what helps

also... I heard somewhere that passing motion helps

passing motion? what's that? and i also use face wash and night cream regularly.

I bought cleansers acne patches to help out since I've been breaking out badly. I sweat a lot and the masks certainly don't help, especially since I'm half dead and a sweaty mess by the time I reach my class.

Although I still have acne it's not as bad as before. What helped me out was washing my face day and night and applying moisturizer. Moisturizer really helps out.

Definitely try Curology or buy the Ordinary products. I've tried both and they both work well. I currently use a the Ordinary face mask and common drug store moisturizer and cleansers, and there's been a noticeable difference. I also saw someone mention vaseline, but I suggest you be careful with that since it can clog your pores.

Mine flare up with caffeine intake, so I try to refrain from as many carbonated drinks and coffee, as much as possible. Dunno if it works for you.
Also, try not to let sweat dry on your face, and wash frequently, since acne mostly is due to sweat clogging up the pores leading to sebum accumulation

I usually consult with a dermatologist. But for emergency, i use bandaids/acne patches to cover the most offending spot. It's quite effective for me, since the patch keep my hands away, conceal the redness, while also suck the liquid inside those acnes out without the need to pop them and thus, reduce the swelling. But, i need to change it several times a day. After 3-4 days of acne patches, the swelling part usually gonna get pretty tame.
But again, what work for me might not work for you.
(Juust a disclaimer, I'm no doctor and this is not a medical advice )

don't have any, if I do get it I guess I just ignore it. Don't think too much about it, but if it's severe go to the derma. My skin used to be crystal clear that I used to get regularly get compliments for it, but a year ago, it started acting up. It's okay now, but I don't think it's as clear as it used to be. Oh well

This is what I do... really helps control
1. Drinking a lot of water
2. Drinking healthy tea (like chrysanthemum tea, 涼茶) / avoid unhealthy foods (actually tbh I don't really do this right now cause I'm a little piggy. But it helps if you have will power to change eating habits.)
3. Change pillowcase everyday + wash blanket cover / sheets once a week
4. Consistent skin care routine. Right now I am using oil cleanser + regular foam cleanser, I'm From Mugwort set, and cosrx AHA and BHA serums.

We put The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch to the test after receiving a complimentary sample from the brand. Keep reading for our full product review. 

Editor’s Note: We reviewed this article on September 24, 2023. As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.

Period, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren't blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month. 

Lucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I'll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.

Keep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.

COSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH

BEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types

KEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid

PRICE: $19

ABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.

About My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts

My skin can be unpredictable. But, as I've gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.  

Ingredients: One key, familiar ingredient 

The tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.

The Feel: Like a bandage

You can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Packaging: Easy to store

The 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish

I placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.

Even with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn't budge overnight.

If you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn't expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn't gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don't believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Value: Worth it

Was this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

Similar Products: You've got options 

squish. Flower Power Acne Patches ($14): This pack of 20 floral hydrocolloid pimple patches to help zap blemishes overnight and let's face it, they're pretty darn cute. Pimple, but make them pretty. 

Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Variety Pack ($7): These 36 count medical-grade, chemical-free, allergy-tested patches stay put no matter how much you toss and turn throughout the night. 

Final Verdict

If you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won't regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.

I stopped eating unhealthy food that causes pimples as much as I can, things like milk chocolate(I prefer dark one anyway), ketchup and other similary industrially over processed foods.
Also found Neutrogena clear and defend rapid gel. Instead of waiting for days until the white head appears, you can pop a pimple in a single day, then just wipe with alchocol which also dries and reduces it.

I once got a lot of acne around the end of my school year on my cheeks and my temples despite regularly washing my face everday (facewash and moisturizer), and it was the largest breakout I've ever had. It stayed for about three months until I saw this tiktok saying Vaseline actually works really well. Then I did a quick search on google and google said it worked (which isnt really a very reliable ig, but I didnt really care), so I ended up trying it. It worked after two weeks of putting Vaseline on my face after using my facewash every night, and worked so fast that the results were obvious. I dont think any other factors were the cause of my rapidly reduced acne because my routine still stayed the same. So, you can try that i guess. Also make sure to keep yourself hydrated and moisturized.
Vaseline as the one u put on ur skin?

my mum buys some facewash and pimple cream from some beautician she knows and I use it
my pimples do not improve significantly though, it mostly depends on my hormone level and whether it's nearing that time of the month
another reason I have acne is because I lie on one side of the bed

I wash my face 2 times a day because my face gets fairly oily
and when those under skin acne pop up I slather a thick layer of pimple cream
occasionally when I'm free I squeeze them with tissues though I know it makes them scar

I'm experimenting with some facewashes rn to see what helps

also... I heard somewhere that passing motion helps

passing motion? what's that? and i also use face wash and night cream regularly.

I don't, i never had acne. Thanks to genetic

Well, actually i do have and luckily it's not on my face, but on my body, esp my back
lucky u, i also have it on my back too but it's not that many.

I bought cleansers acne patches to help out since I've been breaking out badly. I sweat a lot and the masks certainly don't help, especially since I'm half dead and a sweaty mess by the time I reach my class.

Although I still have acne it's not as bad as before. What helped me out was washing my face day and night and applying moisturizer. Moisturizer really helps out.

Definitely try Curology or buy the Ordinary products. I've tried both and they both work well. I currently use a the Ordinary face mask and common drug store moisturizer and cleansers, and there's been a noticeable difference. I also saw someone mention vaseline, but I suggest you be careful with that since it can clog your pores.

I'm sure there's some medicine or therapy for it...if it's too big see doctor they'd clean it out properly.
yeah it usually make it worse

Usual causes of acne are stress, bad hygiene and/or diet. Try to change your beddings regularly too. If changing these things for the better still don't help, then you could only blame your parents for your genetics. Also don't expect immediate results, be patient and be consistent.
yeah guess so, what's wrong with backne tho? not like it's controllable

Mine flare up with caffeine intake, so I try to refrain from as many carbonated drinks and coffee, as much as possible. Dunno if it works for you.
Also, try not to let sweat dry on your face, and wash frequently, since acne mostly is due to sweat clogging up the pores leading to sebum accumulation

I don't usually have this acne but i guess wearing mask all the time makes it this way....
I usually consult with a dermatologist. But for emergency, i use bandaids/acne patches to cover the most offending spot. It's quite effective for me, since the patch keep my hands away, conceal the redness, while also suck the liquid inside those acnes out without the need to pop them and thus, reduce the swelling. But, i need to change it several times a day. After 3-4 days of acne patches, the swelling part usually gonna get pretty tame.
But again, what work for me might not work for you.

don't have any, if I do get it I guess I just ignore it. Don't think too much about it, but if it's severe go to the derma. My skin used to be crystal clear that I used to get regularly get compliments for it, but a year ago, it started acting up. It's okay now, but I don't think it's as clear as it used to be. Oh well

This is what I do... really helps control
1. Drinking a lot of water
2. Drinking healthy tea (like chrysanthemum tea, 涼茶) / avoid unhealthy foods (actually tbh I don't really do this right now cause I'm a little piggy. But it helps if you have will power to change eating habits.)
3. Change pillowcase everyday + wash blanket cover / sheets once a week
4. Consistent skin care routine. Right now I am using oil cleanser + regular foam cleanser, I'm From Mugwort set, and cosrx AHA and BHA serums.

I once got a lot of acne around the end of my school year on my cheeks and my temples despite regularly washing my face everday (facewash and moisturizer), and it was the largest breakout I've ever had. It stayed for about three months until I saw this tiktok saying Vaseline actually works really well. Then I did a quick search on google and google said it worked (which isnt really a very reliable ig, but I didnt really care), so I ended up trying it. It worked after two weeks of putting Vaseline on my face after using my facewash every night, and worked so fast that the results were obvious. I dont think any other factors were the cause of my rapidly reduced acne because my routine still stayed the same. So, you can try that i guess. Also make sure to keep yourself hydrated and moisturized.

my mum buys some facewash and pimple cream from some beautician she knows and I use it
my pimples do not improve significantly though, it mostly depends on my hormone level and whether it's nearing that time of the month
another reason I have acne is because I lie on one side of the bed

I wash my face 2 times a day because my face gets fairly oily
and when those under skin acne pop up I slather a thick layer of pimple cream
occasionally when I'm free I squeeze them with tissues though I know it makes them scar

I'm experimenting with some facewashes rn to see what helps

also... I heard somewhere that passing motion helps

I bought cleansers acne patches to help out since I've been breaking out badly. I sweat a lot and the masks certainly don't help, especially since I'm half dead and a sweaty mess by the time I reach my class.

Although I still have acne it's not as bad as before. What helped me out was washing my face day and night and applying moisturizer. Moisturizer really helps out.

Definitely try Curology or buy the Ordinary products. I've tried both and they both work well. I currently use a the Ordinary face mask and common drug store moisturizer and cleansers, and there's been a noticeable difference. I also saw someone mention vaseline, but I suggest you be careful with that since it can clog your pores.

Isn't popping them making it worse?


I'm sure there's some medicine or therapy for it...if it's too big see doctor they'd clean it out properly.

Usual causes of acne are stress, bad hygiene and/or diet. Try to change your beddings regularly too. If changing these things for the better still don't help, then you could only blame your parents for your genetics. Also don't expect immediate results, be patient and be consistent.

I didn't have those, just pimples that don't leave scars. I always popped them despite being said it's better to leave them, just make sure it's clean afterwards with alchocol.
I stopped eating unhealthy food that causes pimples as much as I can, things like milk chocolate(I prefer dark one anyway), ketchup and other similary industrially over processed foods.
Also found Neutrogena clear and defend rapid gel. Instead of waiting for days until the white head appears, you can pop a pimple in a single day, then just wipe with alchocol which also dries and reduces it.

Mine flare up with caffeine intake, so I try to refrain from as many carbonated drinks and coffee, as much as possible. Dunno if it works for you.
Also, try not to let sweat dry on your face, and wash frequently, since acne mostly is due to sweat clogging up the pores leading to sebum accumulation

I usually consult with a dermatologist. But for emergency, i use bandaids/acne patches to cover the most offending spot. It's quite effective for me, since the patch keep my hands away, conceal the redness, while also suck the liquid inside those acnes out without the need to pop them and thus, reduce the swelling. But, i need to change it several times a day. After 3-4 days of acne patches, the swelling part usually gonna get pretty tame.
But again, what work for me might not work for you.
(Juust a disclaimer, I'm no doctor and this is not a medical advice )

don't have any, if I do get it I guess I just ignore it. Don't think too much about it, but if it's severe go to the derma. My skin used to be crystal clear that I used to get regularly get compliments for it, but a year ago, it started acting up. It's okay now, but I don't think it's as clear as it used to be. Oh well

This is what I do... really helps control
1. Drinking a lot of water
2. Drinking healthy tea (like chrysanthemum tea, 涼茶) / avoid unhealthy foods (actually tbh I don't really do this right now cause I'm a little piggy. But it helps if you have will power to change eating habits.)
3. Change pillowcase everyday + wash blanket cover / sheets once a week
4. Consistent skin care routine. Right now I am using oil cleanser + regular foam cleanser, I'm From Mugwort set, and cosrx AHA and BHA serums.

We put The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch to the test after receiving a complimentary sample from the brand. Keep reading for our full product review. 

Editor’s Note: We reviewed this article on September 24, 2023. As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.

Period, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren't blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month. 

Lucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I'll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.

Keep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.

COSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH

BEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types

KEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid

PRICE: $19

ABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.

About My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts

My skin can be unpredictable. But, as I've gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.  

Ingredients: One key, familiar ingredient 

The tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.

The Feel: Like a bandage

You can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Packaging: Easy to store

The 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish

I placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.

Even with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn't budge overnight.

If you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn't expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn't gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don't believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Value: Worth it

Was this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

Similar Products: You've got options 

squish. Flower Power Acne Patches ($14): This pack of 20 floral hydrocolloid pimple patches to help zap blemishes overnight and let's face it, they're pretty darn cute. Pimple, but make them pretty. 

Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Variety Pack ($7): These 36 count medical-grade, chemical-free, allergy-tested patches stay put no matter how much you toss and turn throughout the night. 

Final Verdict

If you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won't regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.

For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.  

Ingredients: One key, familiar ingredient 

The tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.

The Feel: Like a bandage

You can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Packaging: Easy to store

The 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish

I placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.

Even with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn't budge overnight.

If you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn't expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn't gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don't believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Value: Worth it

Was this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

Similar Products: You've got options

Final Verdict

Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2023
When I bought these I didn’t realize that some of these patches are REALLY SMALL. This is actually a good thing for covering up small pimples, but it makes applying them very difficult. The sheet that the stickers are held on is not well thought out and does not break in the center, which makes removing patches very difficult to do without accidentally folding the patch.

Works the way it supposed to, but the first pack I opened already had a little white dots on the pimple patches. It may have been stored somewhere with moisture, but they still looked new, so I will still be using them. I love that they have a variety of sizes in this pack came with a lot. I typically use a different brand, but they were not available online. Good overall.

These are amazing. I wish I had them when I was a teen with embarrassing acne. Now I have an occasional blemish, and this takes care of it in no time. I put a patch on before bed, and it has never come off while I was sleeping. I also have somewhat sensitive skin, and this has never caused any redness. I highly recommend them.

I've been using these patches for over 5 years now and they have never let me down! They are a constant staple in my skincare routine. They cover up unsightly breakouts while dealing with the problem below the surface (drawing the oil/puss from the breakout and expelling it from your skin). They are easy to apply, can last for over 24 hours on skin, and appear sheer on your skin if you need to wear in public. I typically like to put them on at night after my skincare routine before I go to bed and remove in the morning and will repeat until the breakout is gone. The variety size pack is great so you can tailor to the size of your breakout. There are a lot of these products on the market but these are by far the best and affordable too!

I don’t know how I feel about these, but I keep using them. There is white stuff on them every time I pull them off so they’re pulling something out of king skin, but my acne isn’t necessarily gone for a couple days still. But I feel like they work better than acne cream so would still recommend. Does leave a stick residue I don’t love, but stays on during sleep so I guess it needs to be pretty sticky

I often have acne that flares up and when one goes away, at least one more shows up next door. I expected that to be the case with these, but that did not happen. As I have put the patches on. The acne decreases and nothing pops up to replace it.

I have sensitive skin and I was worried about a possible reaction to the adhesive, but I haven't seen anything like that. I have used them on the same spots multiple days in a row for deep acne and have still not seen any negative reactions. As for the deep acne, it is practically gone and no longer painful to the touch.

As a test, I had two white heads pop up on the same day. I handled one the way I normally would and the other with a patch. The one with the patch is practically gone the next morning and the one that I handled still looks angry and red.

A huge bonus for me is that these patches reduce my likelihood of picking at my acne while it works on reducing them.

I would recommend using them at night because I found myself getting impatient with them, particularly the ones high on my cheeks or on my nose because I could see them sometimes. By leaving them on overnight, they didn't bother me while I was sleeping.

With my flare ups, I can easily use a full sheet in two or three days, which is somewhat concerning given how long flares can last and that there are only four sheets in a package.

I will say that the patches don't always stick the first time depending on which part of my face I put them on, and I haven't seen hardly any results from the smallest patches. I am also still figuring out the best way to moisturize the rest of my face without disturbing the patches.

Despite those slight issues. I will continue to use these to combat my acne because I have seen results overnight, and they have improved my overall skin health.

The sheet that the stickers are held on is not well thought out and does not break in the center, which makes removing patches very difficult to do without accidentally folding the patch.

Works the way it supposed to, but the first pack I opened already had a little white dots on the pimple patches. It may have been stored somewhere with moisture, but they still looked new, so I will still be using them. I love that they have a variety of sizes in this pack came with a lot. I typically use a different brand, but they were not available online. Good overall.

These are amazing. I wish I had them when I was a teen with embarrassing acne. Now I have an occasional blemish, and this takes care of it in no time. I put a patch on before bed, and it has never come off while I was sleeping. I also have somewhat sensitive skin, and this has never caused any redness. I highly recommend them.

I've been using these patches for over 5 years now and they have never let me down! They are a constant staple in my skincare routine. They cover up unsightly breakouts while dealing with the problem below the surface (drawing the oil/puss from the breakout and expelling it from your skin). They are easy to apply, can last for over 24 hours on skin, and appear sheer on your skin if you need to wear in public. I typically like to put them on at night after my skincare routine before I go to bed and remove in the morning and will repeat until the breakout is gone. The variety size pack is great so you can tailor to the size of your breakout. There are a lot of these products on the market but these are by far the best and affordable too!

I don’t know how I feel about these, but I keep using them. There is white stuff on them every time I pull them off so they’re pulling something out of king skin, but my acne isn’t necessarily gone for a couple days still. But I feel like they work better than acne cream so would still recommend. Does leave a stick residue I don’t love, but stays on during sleep so I guess it needs to be pretty sticky

I often have acne that flares up and when one goes away, at least one more shows up next door. I expected that to be the case with these, but that did not happen. As I have put the patches on. The acne decreases and nothing pops up to replace it.

I have sensitive skin and I was worried about a possible reaction to the adhesive, but I haven't seen anything like that. I have used them on the same spots multiple days in a row for deep acne and have still not seen any negative reactions. As for the deep acne, it is practically gone and no longer painful to the touch.

As a test, I had two white heads pop up on the same day. I handled one the way I normally would and the other with a patch. The one with the patch is practically gone the next morning and the one that I handled still looks angry and red.

A huge bonus for me is that these patches reduce my likelihood of picking at my acne while it works on reducing them.

I would recommend using them at night because I found myself getting impatient with them, particularly the ones high on my cheeks or on my nose because I could see them sometimes. By leaving them on overnight, they didn't bother me while I was sleeping.

With my flare ups, I can easily use a full sheet in two or three days, which is somewhat concerning given how long flares can last and that there are only four sheets in a package.

I will say that the patches don't always stick the first time depending on which part of my face I put them on, and I haven't seen hardly any results from the smallest patches. I am also still figuring out the best way to moisturize the rest of my face without disturbing the patches.

Despite those slight issues. I will continue to use these to combat my acne because I have seen results overnight, and they have improved my overall skin health.

We put The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch to the test after receiving a complimentary sample from the brand. Keep reading for our full product review. 

Editor’s Note: We reviewed this article on September 24, 2023. As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.

Period, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren't blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month. 

Lucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I'll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.

Keep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.

COSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH

BEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types

KEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid

PRICE: $19

ABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.

About My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts

My skin can be unpredictable. But, as I've gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.  

Ingredients: One key, familiar ingredient 

The tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.

The Feel: Like a bandage

You can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Packaging: Easy to store

The 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish

I placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.

Even with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn't budge overnight.

If you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn't expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn't gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don't believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Value: Worth it

Was this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

Similar Products: You've got options 

squish. Flower Power Acne Patches ($14): This pack of 20 floral hydrocolloid pimple patches to help zap blemishes overnight and let's face it, they're pretty darn cute. Pimple, but make them pretty. 

Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Variety Pack ($7): These 36 count medical-grade, chemical-free, allergy-tested patches stay put no matter how much you toss and turn throughout the night. 

Final Verdict

If you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won't regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.

Expected better from Cosrx
Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2023
When I bought these I didn’t realize that some of these patches are REALLY SMALL. This is actually a good thing for covering up small pimples, but it makes applying them very difficult. The sheet that the stickers are held on is not well thought out and does not break in the center, which makes removing patches very difficult to do without accidentally folding the patch.

Works the way it supposed to, but the first pack I opened already had a little white dots on the pimple patches. It may have been stored somewhere with moisture, but they still looked new, so I will still be using them. I love that they have a variety of sizes in this pack came with a lot. I typically use a different brand, but they were not available online. Good overall.

These are amazing. I wish I had them when I was a teen with embarrassing acne. Now I have an occasional blemish, and this takes care of it in no time. I put a patch on before bed, and it has never come off while I was sleeping. I also have somewhat sensitive skin, and this has never caused any redness. I highly recommend them.

 A product that actually does what it advertises
Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2023

I've been using these patches for over 5 years now and they have never let me down! They are a constant staple in my skincare routine. They cover up unsightly breakouts while dealing with the problem below the surface (drawing the oil/puss from the breakout and expelling it from your skin). They are easy to apply, can last for over 24 hours on skin, and appear sheer on your skin if you need to wear in public. I typically like to put them on at night after my skincare routine before I go to bed and remove in the morning and will repeat until the breakout is gone. The variety size pack is great so you can tailor to the size of your breakout. There are a lot of these products on the market but these are by far the best and affordable too!

I don’t know how I feel about these, but I keep using them. There is white stuff on them every time I pull them off so they’re pulling something out of king skin, but my acne isn’t necessarily gone for a couple days still. But I feel like they work better than acne cream so would still recommend. Does leave a stick residue I don’t love, but stays on during sleep so I guess it needs to be pretty sticky

I often have acne that flares up and when one goes away, at least one more shows up next door. I expected that to be the case with these, but that did not happen. As I have put the patches on. The acne decreases and nothing pops up to replace it.

I have sensitive skin and I was worried about a possible reaction to the adhesive, but I haven't seen anything like that. I have used them on the same spots multiple days in a row for deep acne and have still not seen any negative reactions. As for the deep acne, it is practically gone and no longer painful to the touch.

As a test, I had two white heads pop up on the same day. I handled one the way I normally would and the other with a patch. The one with the patch is practically gone the next morning and the one that I handled still looks angry and red.

A huge bonus for me is that these patches reduce my likelihood of picking at my acne while it works on reducing them.

I would recommend using them at night because I found myself getting impatient with them, particularly the ones high on my cheeks or on my nose because I could see them sometimes. By leaving them on overnight, they didn't bother me while I was sleeping.

With my flare ups, I can easily use a full sheet in two or three days, which is somewhat concerning given how long flares can last and that there are only four sheets in a package.

I will say that the patches don't always stick the first time depending on which part of my face I put them on, and I haven't seen hardly any results from the smallest patches. I am also still figuring out the best way to moisturize the rest of my face without disturbing the patches.

Despite those slight issues. I will continue to use these to combat my acne because I have seen results overnight, and they have improved my overall skin health.

Exactly the same as what a got from physical beauty stores but way cheaper. It's so thin so it won't be too obvious when I wear it out, and it can prevent me to keep touching the inflaming area. Nice product!

We put The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch to the test after receiving a complimentary sample from the brand. Keep reading for our full product review. 

Editor’s Note: We reviewed this article on September 24, 2023. As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.

Period, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren't blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month. 

Lucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I'll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.

Keep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.

COSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH

BEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types

KEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid

PRICE: $19

ABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.

About My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts

My skin can be unpredictable. But, as I've gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.  

Ingredients: One key, familiar ingredient 

The tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.

The Feel: Like a bandage

You can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Packaging: Easy to store

The 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish

I placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.

Even with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn't budge overnight.

If you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn't expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn't gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don't believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Value: Worth it

Was this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

Similar Products: You've got options 

squish. Flower Power Acne Patches ($14): This pack of 20 floral hydrocolloid pimple patches to help zap blemishes overnight and let's face it, they're pretty darn cute. Pimple, but make them pretty. 

Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Variety Pack ($7): These 36 count medical-grade, chemical-free, allergy-tested patches stay put no matter how much you toss and turn throughout the night. 

Final Verdict

If you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won't regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.

Product Description

	

	



See Whitehead / Blemish?

Derma Angel works best on Whiteheads.

Be prepared:

Cleanse the skin carefully and let it dry. (You can also apply moisturizer and let it dry completely if your skin is very dry).

	
Patch it up and the healing starts!

Now you can put on the acne patches to cover your zit!

Press it gently to make sure the acne patch is sticking securely. Then, you can either put on makeup and go out or go to sleep. The healing process starts as it absorbs all the pus and bacteria clogged in your pore.

	
Say bye to acne after 6 hours

Peel it off and moisturize the area after 6 hours or overnight (no more than 12 hours). You might see white, creamy areas on your used patches. That is the pus that was sucked out from your pore!

It's normal that you might need to use another acne patch to pull out more gunk depending on the size of your whitehead.

	

	

	



Hand contact-free

Just tear it off, put it on, and you're good to go in less than 5 seconds!

	
Anti-fingerprint

Our pimple patches feature a special pull-open wrapper for fast, hygienic opening.

	
Apply in a sanitary way

Ensuring you don't touch the patch and reducing the risk of contamination.

	
Your pimples just disappear!

The acne stickers will instantly cover up your pimples and slightly correct the redness. (Covering them with foundation gives an even better result.)

 Works great!
Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2023
Verified Purchase
I have used a similar star shaped product several times and decided to try derma Angel instead this time, and I’m so glad I did! I like this product so much better than the stars and will never go back. These come with 2 sizes in the package, small ones for during the day that are inconspicuous enough to wear out without everyone noticing, and a slightly larger version for overnight. These have consistently stayed put where I stick them and reliably work overnight. They are clear, but turn white where they have sucked out the moisture from your blemish, so you can literally see how well they’ve worked while you were sleeping. If I notice a blemish forming, I put this on and go to bed, and the lump and soreness are gone in the morning. Amazing!

 Super thin and great for daytime use
Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2023
Pattern Name: Intensive-2 Size/132 CountVerified Purchase
I’ve been a longtime user of pimple patches. I was looking for a more affordable option that was thin for daytime use while also being effective. I also tend to get cystic acne that hangs around, so quantity was also important. This fit the bill! I love how it comes with two sizes. It is also really thin and surprised at how easily it blends into my skin compared to others I have tried. I like how this one also contains salicylic acid for stubborn acne that needs to be dried out. My only complaint was that the sticker can be hard to remove from the backing. The perforated lines don’t really tear. It may get easier as I get used to it, but wasn’t super intuitive in the beginning.

It takes few of the first patches to get used to putting on the right spot but after a while it is easy. Wasted almost 15 or 20 just trying to get used to it. But the product works. It's not a right away fix but helps effectively and takes few days.

 Great patches!
Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2023
Pattern Name: Intensive-2 Size/132 CountVerified Purchase
Great patches! They are basically invisible on the face and work really well. I got the intensive ones and do feel they are better than regular strength. I like the perforation on the patches to keep from pulling them off with fingernails, which makes the sides lift up once applied to the face.

 Super thin and great for daytime use
Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2023
Pattern Name: Intensive-2 Size/132 CountVerified Purchase
I’ve been a longtime user of pimple patches. I was looking for a more affordable option that was thin for daytime use while also being effective. I also tend to get cystic acne that hangs around, so quantity was also important. This fit the bill! I love how it comes with two sizes. It is also really thin and surprised at how easily it blends into my skin compared to others I have tried. I like how this one also contains salicylic acid for stubborn acne that needs to be dried out. My only complaint was that the sticker can be hard to remove from the backing. The perforated lines don’t really tear. It may get easier as I get used to it, but wasn’t super intuitive in the beginning.

It takes few of the first patches to get used to putting on the right spot but after a while it is easy. Wasted almost 15 or 20 just trying to get used to it. But the product works. It's not a right away fix but helps effectively and takes few days.

 Great patches!
Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2023
Pattern Name: Intensive-2 Size/132 CountVerified Purchase
Great patches! They are basically invisible on the face and work really well. I got the intensive ones and do feel they are better than regular strength. I like the perforation on the patches to keep from pulling them off with fingernails, which makes the sides lift up once applied to the face.

Product Description

	

	



See Whitehead / Blemish?

Derma Angel works best on Whiteheads.

Be prepared:

Cleanse the skin carefully and let it dry. (You can also apply moisturizer and let it dry completely if your skin is very dry).

	
Patch it up and the healing starts!

Now you can put on the acne patches to cover your zit!

Press it gently to make sure the acne patch is sticking securely. Then, you can either put on makeup and go out or go to sleep. The healing process starts as it absorbs all the pus and bacteria clogged in your pore.

	
Say bye to acne after 6 hours

Peel it off and moisturize the area after 6 hours or overnight (no more than 12 hours). You might see white, creamy areas on your used patches. That is the pus that was sucked out from your pore!

It's normal that you might need to use another acne patch to pull out more gunk depending on the size of your whitehead.

	

	

	



Hand contact-free

Just tear it off, put it on, and you're good to go in less than 5 seconds!

	
Anti-fingerprint

Our pimple patches feature a special pull-open wrapper for fast, hygienic opening.

	
Apply in a sanitary way

Ensuring you don't touch the patch and reducing the risk of contamination.

	
Your pimples just disappear!

The acne stickers will instantly cover up your pimples and slightly correct the redness. (Covering them with foundation gives an even better result.)

 Works great!
Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2023

I have used a similar star shaped product several times and decided to try derma Angel instead this time, and I’m so glad I did! I like this product so much better than the stars and will never go back. These come with 2 sizes in the package, small ones for during the day that are inconspicuous enough to wear out without everyone noticing, and a slightly larger version for overnight. These have consistently stayed put where I stick them and reliably work overnight. They are clear, but turn white where they have sucked out the moisture from your blemish, so you can literally see how well they’ve worked while you were sleeping. If I notice a blemish forming, I put this on and go to bed, and the lump and soreness are gone in the morning. Amazing!

Product Description

	

	



See Whitehead / Blemish?

Derma Angel works best on Whiteheads.

Be prepared:

Cleanse the skin carefully and let it dry. (You can also apply moisturizer and let it dry completely if your skin is very dry).

	
Patch it up and the healing starts!

Now you can put on the acne patches to cover your zit!

Press it gently to make sure the acne patch is sticking securely. Then, you can either put on makeup and go out or go to sleep. The healing process starts as it absorbs all the pus and bacteria clogged in your pore.

	
Say bye to acne after 6 hours

Peel it off and moisturize the area after 6 hours or overnight (no more than 12 hours). You might see white, creamy areas on your used patches. That is the pus that was sucked out from your pore!

It's normal that you might need to use another acne patch to pull out more gunk depending on the size of your whitehead.

	

	

	



Hand contact-free

Just tear it off, put it on, and you're good to go in less than 5 seconds!

	
Anti-fingerprint

Our pimple patches feature a special pull-open wrapper for fast, hygienic opening.

	
Apply in a sanitary way

Ensuring you don't touch the patch and reducing the risk of contamination.

	
Your pimples just disappear!

The acne stickers will instantly cover up your pimples and slightly correct the redness. (Covering them with foundation gives an even better result.)

 Works great!
Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2023

I have used a similar star shaped product several times and decided to try derma Angel instead this time, and I’m so glad I did! I like this product so much better than the stars and will never go back. These come with 2 sizes in the package, small ones for during the day that are inconspicuous enough to wear out without everyone noticing, and a slightly larger version for overnight. These have consistently stayed put where I stick them and reliably work overnight. They are clear, but turn white where they have sucked out the moisture from your blemish, so you can literally see how well they’ve worked while you were sleeping. If I notice a blemish forming, I put this on and go to bed, and the lump and soreness are gone in the morning. Amazing!

 Super thin and great for daytime use
Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2023
Pattern Name: Intensive-2 Size/132 CountVerified Purchase
I’ve been a longtime user of pimple patches. I was looking for a more affordable option that was thin for daytime use while also being effective. I also tend to get cystic acne that hangs around, so quantity was also important. This fit the bill! I love how it comes with two sizes. It is also really thin and surprised at how easily it blends into my skin compared to others I have tried. I like how this one also contains salicylic acid for stubborn acne that needs to be dried out. My only complaint was that the sticker can be hard to remove from the backing. The perforated lines don’t really tear. It may get easier as I get used to it, but wasn’t super intuitive in the beginning.

It takes few of the first patches to get used to putting on the right spot but after a while it is easy. Wasted almost 15 or 20 just trying to get used to it. But the product works. It's not a right away fix but helps effectively and takes few days.

 Great patches!

Pattern Name: Intensive-2 Size/132 CountVerified Purchase
Great patches! They are basically invisible on the face and work really well. I got the intensive ones and do feel they are better than regular strength. I like the perforation on the patches to keep from pulling them off with fingernails, which makes the sides lift up once applied to the face.

Product Description

	

	



See Whitehead / Blemish?

Derma Angel works best on Whiteheads.

Be prepared:

Cleanse the skin carefully and let it dry. (You can also apply moisturizer and let it dry completely if your skin is very dry).

	
Patch it up and the healing starts!

Now you can put on the acne patches to cover your zit!

Press it gently to make sure the acne patch is sticking securely. Then, you can either put on makeup and go out or go to sleep. The healing process starts as it absorbs all the pus and bacteria clogged in your pore.

	
Say bye to acne after 6 hours

Peel it off and moisturize the area after 6 hours or overnight (no more than 12 hours). You might see white, creamy areas on your used patches. That is the pus that was sucked out from your pore!

It's normal that you might need to use another acne patch to pull out more gunk depending on the size of your whitehead.

	

	

	



Hand contact-free

Just tear it off, put it on, and you're good to go in less than 5 seconds!

	
Anti-fingerprint

Our pimple patches feature a special pull-open wrapper for fast, hygienic opening.

	
Apply in a sanitary way

Ensuring you don't touch the patch and reducing the risk of contamination.

	
Your pimples just disappear!

The acne stickers will instantly cover up your pimples and slightly correct the redness. (Covering them with foundation gives an even better result.)

 Works great!
Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2023
Verified Purchase
I have used a similar star shaped product several times and decided to try derma Angel instead this time, and I’m so glad I did! I like this product so much better than the stars and will never go back. These come with 2 sizes in the package, small ones for during the day that are inconspicuous enough to wear out without everyone noticing, and a slightly larger version for overnight. These have consistently stayed put where I stick them and reliably work overnight. They are clear, but turn white where they have sucked out the moisture from your blemish, so you can literally see how well they’ve worked while you were sleeping. If I notice a blemish forming, I put this on and go to bed, and the lump and soreness are gone in the morning. Amazing!

I wasn’t sure about this product but it did work and fast! It takes care of blemishes overnight. No fuss or mess. Simply clean the affected area and put one of these patches on overnight and see the results in the morning. You’ll love the ease of use and the results!

 Super thin and great for daytime use
Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2023
Pattern Name: Intensive-2 Size/132 CountVerified Purchase
I’ve been a longtime user of pimple patches. I was looking for a more affordable option that was thin for daytime use while also being effective. I also tend to get cystic acne that hangs around, so quantity was also important. This fit the bill! I love how it comes with two sizes. It is also really thin and surprised at how easily it blends into my skin compared to others I have tried. I like how this one also contains salicylic acid for stubborn acne that needs to be dried out. My only complaint was that the sticker can be hard to remove from the backing. The perforated lines don’t really tear. It may get easier as I get used to it, but wasn’t super intuitive in the beginning.

It takes few of the first patches to get used to putting on the right spot but after a while it is easy. Wasted almost 15 or 20 just trying to get used to it. But the product works. It's not a right away fix but helps effectively and takes few days.

 Great patches!
Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2023
Pattern Name: Intensive-2 Size/132 CountVerified Purchase
Great patches! They are basically invisible on the face and work really well. I got the intensive ones and do feel they are better than regular strength. I like the perforation on the patches to keep from pulling them off with fingernails, which makes the sides lift up once applied to the face.

I have used a similar star shaped product several times and decided to try derma Angel instead this time, and I’m so glad I did! I like this product so much better than the stars and will never go back. These come with 2 sizes in the package, small ones for during the day that are inconspicuous enough to wear out without everyone noticing, and a slightly larger version for overnight. These have consistently stayed put where I stick them and reliably work overnight. They are clear, but turn white where they have sucked out the moisture from your blemish, so you can literally see how well they’ve worked while you were sleeping. If I notice a blemish forming, I put this on and go to bed, and the lump and soreness are gone in the morning. Amazing!

I wasn’t sure about this product but it did work and fast! It takes care of blemishes overnight. No fuss or mess. Simply clean the affected area and put one of these patches on overnight and see the results in the morning. You’ll love the ease of use and the results!

 Super thin and great for daytime use
Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2023
Pattern Name: Intensive-2 Size/132 CountVerified Purchase
I’ve been a longtime user of pimple patches. I was looking for a more affordable option that was thin for daytime use while also being effective. I also tend to get cystic acne that hangs around, so quantity was also important. This fit the bill! I love how it comes with two sizes. It is also really thin and surprised at how easily it blends into my skin compared to others I have tried. I like how this one also contains salicylic acid for stubborn acne that needs to be dried out. My only complaint was that the sticker can be hard to remove from the backing. The perforated lines don’t really tear. It may get easier as I get used to it, but wasn’t super intuitive in the beginning.

It takes few of the first patches to get used to putting on the right spot but after a while it is easy. Wasted almost 15 or 20 just trying to get used to it. But the product works. It's not a right away fix but helps effectively and takes few days.

 Great patches!
Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2023
Pattern Name: Intensive-2 Size/132 CountVerified Purchase
Great patches! They are basically invisible on the face and work really well. I got the intensive ones and do feel they are better than regular strength. I like the perforation on the patches to keep from pulling them off with fingernails, which makes the sides lift up once applied to the face.

Product Description

	

	



See Whitehead / Blemish?

Derma Angel works best on Whiteheads.

Be prepared:

Cleanse the skin carefully and let it dry. (You can also apply moisturizer and let it dry completely if your skin is very dry).

	
Patch it up and the healing starts!

Now you can put on the acne patches to cover your zit!

Press it gently to make sure the acne patch is sticking securely. Then, you can either put on makeup and go out or go to sleep. The healing process starts as it absorbs all the pus and bacteria clogged in your pore.

	
Say bye to acne after 6 hours

Peel it off and moisturize the area after 6 hours or overnight (no more than 12 hours). You might see white, creamy areas on your used patches. That is the pus that was sucked out from your pore!

It's normal that you might need to use another acne patch to pull out more gunk depending on the size of your whitehead.

	

	

	



Hand contact-free

Just tear it off, put it on, and you're good to go in less than 5 seconds!

	
Anti-fingerprint

Our pimple patches feature a special pull-open wrapper for fast, hygienic opening.

	
Apply in a sanitary way

Ensuring you don't touch the patch and reducing the risk of contamination.

	
Your pimples just disappear!

The acne stickers will instantly cover up your pimples and slightly correct the redness. (Covering them with foundation gives an even better result.)

FAQ
What is hydrocolloid?

Hydrocolloid was originally designed for use as a medical bandage or dressing for wounds. It has a gel layer that’s formulated with pectin or gelatin and other ingredients that attract water and absorb fluids (such as pus). Mighty Patch is not made with gelatin and therefore is vegan-friendly. As the hydrocolloid draws in fluids or pus, the patch changes from transparent to opaque white, which is all the gunk that was pulled from the pimple. Read more about hydrocolloid and how it works here.

How do I use Mighty Patch?

Mighty Patch is a gentle (yet super-effective) pimple patch. To be exact, it’s a transparent hydrocolloid sticker that sucks up pus and protects the skin.

First, thoroughly clean and dry the blemish and surrounding area. Apply a Mighty Patch directly on top of the blemish and leave it on until the sticker turns opaque white, which generally takes about six hours. If there is still pus left in the pimple after your patch is removed, you can replace it with a new patch. Mighty Patch is safe to use overnight or during the day.

What kind of pimple is Mighty Patch designed for?

Since hydrocolloid attracts water and fluid, Mighty Patch works best on pimples that have come to a head (in other words, you can see white fluid or pus trapped in the pimple). If you tried a Mighty Patch and it didn’t change from transparent to opaque white, your pimple might not have been “mature” enough or the right type of blemish.

If you have cystic acne, we recommend you see a doctor or dermatologist for professional treatment.

What’s the difference between Mighty Patch Original, Invisible+ and Surface?

Mighty Patch Original is the Hero Cosmetics OG. It’s our nighttime patch and comes in one size. Mighty Patch Invisible+ is ultra thin and has tapered edges that seamlessly blend into your skin, making it perfect for daytime use. Mighty Patch Surfaceis best for cluster (or large area) breakouts (e.g., along the jawline, cheeks and forehead).

Is the Mighty Patch safe to use alongside acne prescription medication?

We recommend you consult your doctor before using any prescription drugs with Mighty Patch.

What's the maximum length of time I should wear a patch?

If you've worn the patch for over 6 hours and it hasn't absorbed anything, it can mean a few things:

- The pimple does not have fluid in it so it's not "ripe" yet or not the right type of pimple
- The pimple does have fluid in it but the fluid is deep in the pore. The patch can help coax the fluid to the surface and then coax it out but this will take 1-3 days depending on how deep the fluid is.
- The patch needs easier access to the fluid. Some customers have seen that popping or pricking the pimple can help draw out the fluid faster onto the patch.

We advise you wear the patch for 6-8 hours or until the patch has absorbed the gunk out, whichever is first. If after 6-8 hours, the patch has not absorbed anything, please see above. Let us know if you have other questions!

Here's a blog article that explains the reasons why the patch may not have worked and how to fix it.

How is Mighty Patch different from other acne solutions?

No harsh chemicals or formulas that dry out skin
Won’t irritate sensitive skin
Acts as a protective barrier against germs and bacteria
Prevents touching and picking, which can worsen blemishes or cause scarring
Visibly shows that it’s working by changing from transparent to white
Easy to use, small, light and portable
100% safe and FDA-approved
Safe for pregnant women and nursing moms

What do I do after I take off my patch?

First, wash your skin using a low pH-cleanser, followed by an exfoliator. After skin is dry, use a moisturizer to nourish your skin. Read more about post-patch care here.

Is Mighty Patch cruelty-free?

Yes! Mighty Patch is cruelty-free and vegan-friendly as well as latex free. We do not test on animals in any country, nor do we work with suppliers or manufacturers that test on animals. The products we create represent our values, including the belief that animals should not be hurt at the expense of good skin.

Is Mighty Patch safe for pregnant women and nursing moms?

Yes! Mighty Patch is not formulated with harsh chemicals, so it's the perfect acne spot treatment for pregnant women. We interviewed dermatologist Dr. Jenny Liu during her pregnancy, and she recommended Mighty Patch as a safe treatment for pregnant women. Read the interview on our blog here.

That being said, we suggest confirming with your doctor since every pregnancy is different.

As the hydrocolloid draws in fluids or pus, the patch changes from transparent to opaque white, which is all the gunk that was pulled from the pimple. Read more about hydrocolloid and how it works here.

How do I use Mighty Patch?

Mighty Patch is a gentle (yet super-effective) pimple patch. To be exact, it’s a transparent hydrocolloid sticker that sucks up pus and protects the skin.

First, thoroughly clean and dry the blemish and surrounding area. Apply a Mighty Patch directly on top of the blemish and leave it on until the sticker turns opaque white, which generally takes about six hours. If there is still pus left in the pimple after your patch is removed, you can replace it with a new patch. Mighty Patch is safe to use overnight or during the day.

What kind of pimple is Mighty Patch designed for?

Since hydrocolloid attracts water and fluid, Mighty Patch works best on pimples that have come to a head (in other words, you can see white fluid or pus trapped in the pimple). If you tried a Mighty Patch and it didn’t change from transparent to opaque white, your pimple might not have been “mature” enough or the right type of blemish.

If you have cystic acne, we recommend you see a doctor or dermatologist for professional treatment.

What’s the difference between Mighty Patch Original, Invisible+ and Surface?

Mighty Patch Original is the Hero Cosmetics OG. It’s our nighttime patch and comes in one size. Mighty Patch Invisible+ is ultra thin and has tapered edges that seamlessly blend into your skin, making it perfect for daytime use. Mighty Patch Surfaceis best for cluster (or large area) breakouts (e.g., along the jawline, cheeks and forehead).

Is the Mighty Patch safe to use alongside acne prescription medication?

We recommend you consult your doctor before using any prescription drugs with Mighty Patch.

What's the maximum length of time I should wear a patch?

If you've worn the patch for over 6 hours and it hasn't absorbed anything, it can mean a few things:

- The pimple does not have fluid in it so it's not "ripe" yet or not the right type of pimple
- The pimple does have fluid in it but the fluid is deep in the pore. The patch can help coax the fluid to the surface and then coax it out but this will take 1-3 days depending on how deep the fluid is.
- The patch needs easier access to the fluid. Some customers have seen that popping or pricking the pimple can help draw out the fluid faster onto the patch.

We advise you wear the patch for 6-8 hours or until the patch has absorbed the gunk out, whichever is first. If after 6-8 hours, the patch has not absorbed anything, please see above. Let us know if you have other questions!

Here's a blog article that explains the reasons why the patch may not have worked and how to fix it.

How is Mighty Patch different from other acne solutions?

No harsh chemicals or formulas that dry out skin
Won’t irritate sensitive skin
Acts as a protective barrier against germs and bacteria
Prevents touching and picking, which can worsen blemishes or cause scarring
Visibly shows that it’s working by changing from transparent to white
Easy to use, small, light and portable
100% safe and FDA-approved
Safe for pregnant women and nursing moms

What do I do after I take off my patch?

First, wash your skin using a low pH-cleanser, followed by an exfoliator. After skin is dry, use a moisturizer to nourish your skin. Read more about post-patch care here.

Is Mighty Patch cruelty-free?

Yes! Mighty Patch is cruelty-free and vegan-friendly as well as latex free. We do not test on animals in any country, nor do we work with suppliers or manufacturers that test on animals. The products we create represent our values, including the belief that animals should not be hurt at the expense of good skin.

Is Mighty Patch safe for pregnant women and nursing moms?

Yes! Mighty Patch is not formulated with harsh chemicals, so it's the perfect acne spot treatment for pregnant women. We interviewed dermatologist Dr. Jenny Liu during her pregnancy, and she recommended Mighty Patch as a safe treatment for pregnant women. Read the interview on our blog here.

That being said, we suggest confirming with your doctor since every pregnancy is different.

If you tried a Mighty Patch and it didn’t change from transparent to opaque white, your pimple might not have been “mature” enough or the right type of blemish.

If you have cystic acne, we recommend you see a doctor or dermatologist for professional treatment.

What’s the difference between Mighty Patch Original, Invisible+ and Surface?

Mighty Patch Original is the Hero Cosmetics OG. It’s our nighttime patch and comes in one size. Mighty Patch Invisible+ is ultra thin and has tapered edges that seamlessly blend into your skin, making it perfect for daytime use. Mighty Patch Surfaceis best for cluster (or large area) breakouts (e.g., along the jawline, cheeks and forehead).

Is the Mighty Patch safe to use alongside acne prescription medication?

We recommend you consult your doctor before using any prescription drugs with Mighty Patch.

What's the maximum length of time I should wear a patch?

If you've worn the patch for over 6 hours and it hasn't absorbed anything, it can mean a few things:

- The pimple does not have fluid in it so it's not "ripe" yet or not the right type of pimple
- The pimple does have fluid in it but the fluid is deep in the pore. The patch can help coax the fluid to the surface and then coax it out but this will take 1-3 days depending on how deep the fluid is.
- The patch needs easier access to the fluid. Some customers have seen that popping or pricking the pimple can help draw out the fluid faster onto the patch.

We advise you wear the patch for 6-8 hours or until the patch has absorbed the gunk out, whichever is first. If after 6-8 hours, the patch has not absorbed anything, please see above. Let us know if you have other questions!

Here's a blog article that explains the reasons why the patch may not have worked and how to fix it.

Is Mighty Patch cruelty-free?

Yes! Mighty Patch is cruelty-free and vegan-friendly as well as latex free. We do not test on animals in any country, nor do we work with suppliers or manufacturers that test on animals. The products we create represent our values, including the belief that animals should not be hurt at the expense of good skin.

Is Mighty Patch safe for pregnant women and nursing moms?

Yes! Mighty Patch is not formulated with harsh chemicals, so it's the perfect acne spot treatment for pregnant women. We interviewed dermatologist Dr. Jenny Liu during her pregnancy, and she recommended Mighty Patch as a safe treatment for pregnant women. Read the interview on our blog here.

That being said, we suggest confirming with your doctor since every pregnancy is different.

FAQ
What is hydrocolloid?

Hydrocolloid was originally designed for use as a medical bandage or dressing for wounds. It has a gel layer that’s formulated with pectin or gelatin and other ingredients that attract water and absorb fluids (such as pus). Mighty Patch is not made with gelatin and therefore is vegan-friendly. As the hydrocolloid draws in fluids or pus, the patch changes from transparent to opaque white, which is all the gunk that was pulled from the pimple. Read more about hydrocolloid and how it works here.

How do I use Mighty Patch?

Mighty Patch is a gentle (yet super-effective) pimple patch. To be exact, it’s a transparent hydrocolloid sticker that sucks up pus and protects the skin.

First, thoroughly clean and dry the blemish and surrounding area. Apply a Mighty Patch directly on top of the blemish and leave it on until the sticker turns opaque white, which generally takes about six hours. If there is still pus left in the pimple after your patch is removed, you can replace it with a new patch. Mighty Patch is safe to use overnight or during the day.

What kind of pimple is Mighty Patch designed for?

Since hydrocolloid attracts water and fluid, Mighty Patch works best on pimples that have come to a head (in other words, you can see white fluid or pus trapped in the pimple). If you tried a Mighty Patch and it didn’t change from transparent to opaque white, your pimple might not have been “mature” enough or the right type of blemish.

We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.\n\nPeriod, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren\'t blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month.\xa0\n\nLucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I\'ll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.\n\nKeep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.\n\nCOSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH\n\nBEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types\n\nKEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid\n\nPRICE: $19\n\nABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.\n\nAbout My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts\n\nMy skin can be unpredictable. But, as I\'ve gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.\xa0\xa0\n\nIngredients: One key, familiar ingredient\xa0\n\nThe tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.\n\nThe Feel: Like a bandage\n\nYou can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Packaging: Easy to store\n\nThe 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish\n\nI placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.\n\nEven with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn\'t budge overnight.\n\nIf you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn\'t expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn\'t gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don\'t believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Value: Worth it\n\nWas this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nSimilar Products: You\'ve got options\xa0\n\nsquish.

But for emergency, i use bandaids/acne patches to cover the most offending spot. It\'s quite effective for me, since the patch keep my hands away, conceal the redness, while also suck the liquid inside those acnes out without the need to pop them and thus, reduce the swelling. But, i need to change it several times a day.

But for emergency, i use bandaids/acne patches to cover the most offending spot. It\'s quite effective for me, since the patch keep my hands away, conceal the redness, while also suck the liquid inside those acnes out without the need to pop them and thus, reduce the swelling. But, i need to change it several times a day.

Spaitis\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Works great!\nReviewed in the United States on October 15, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nI have used a similar star shaped product several times and decided to try derma Angel instead this time, and I’m so glad I did! I like this product so much better than the stars and will never go back. These come with 2 sizes in the package, small ones for during the day that are inconspicuous enough to wear out without everyone noticing, and a slightly larger version for overnight. These have consistently stayed put where I stick them and reliably work overnight. They are clear, but turn white where they have sucked out the moisture from your blemish, so you can literally see how well they’ve worked while you were sleeping. If I notice a blemish forming, I put this on and go to bed, and the lump and soreness are gone in the morning. Amazing!\nHelpful\nReport\n\tScott\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n It Works!\nReviewed in the United States on October 12, 2023\nPattern Name: Intensive-2 Size/96 CountVerified Purchase\nI wasn’t sure about this product but it did work and fast! It takes care of blemishes overnight. No fuss or mess. Simply clean the affected area and put one of these patches on overnight and see the results in the morning. You’ll love the ease of use and the results!\nHelpful\nReport\n\tAmazon Customer\n4.0 out of 5 stars\n Great product\nReviewed in the United States on October 11, 2023\nPattern Name: Intensive-2 Size/132 CountVerified Purchase\nI like the product overall as it works great to eliminate breakouts, especially those already forming but still need to try cystic the paper removal is easy and ensures it goes on smoothly.\nHelpful\nReport\n\tmoreboba\n4.0 out of 5 stars\n Super thin and great for daytime use\nReviewed in the United States on August 22, 2023\nPattern Name: Intensive-2 Size/132 CountVerified Purchase\nI’ve been a longtime user of pimple patches. I was looking for a more affordable option that was thin for daytime use while also being effective. I also tend to get cystic acne that hangs around, so quantity was also important. This fit the bill! I love how it comes with two sizes. It is also really thin and surprised at how easily it blends into my skin compared to others I have tried. I like how this one also contains salicylic acid for stubborn acne that needs to be dried out. My only complaint was that the sticker can be hard to remove from the backing. The perforated lines don’t really tear. It may get easier as I get used to it, but wasn’t super intuitive in the beginning.\n4 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tMeadow\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Helped reduce redness!\nReviewed in the United States on October 16, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nThis product was great getting to work on my skin overnight and it was so satisfying to look at the patch when finished!\nHelpful\nReport\n\tAnish Kumar\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Helps\nReviewed in the United States on September 25, 2023\nPattern Name: Intensive-2 Size/132 CountVerified Purchase\nIt takes few of the first patches to get used to putting on the right spot but after a while it is easy. Wasted almost 15 or 20 just trying to get used to it. But the product works. It\'s not a right away fix but helps effectively and takes few days.\nHelpful\nReport\n\tKristen\n4.0 out of 5 stars\n Great patches!\nReviewed in the United States on September 18, 2023\nPattern Name: Intensive-2 Size/132 CountVerified Purchase\nGreat patches! They are basically invisible on the face and work really well. I got the intensive ones and do feel they are better than regular strength. I like the perforation on the patches to keep from pulling them off with fingernails, which makes the sides lift up once applied to the face.\n2 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tAbfab KC\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n They work great!\nReviewed in the United States on October 16, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nThey work great & you can barely see them.\nHelpful\nReport\nSee more reviews\n\nDisclaimer: While we work to ensure that product information is correct, on occasion manufacturers may alter their ingredient lists.

As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.\n\nPeriod, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren\'t blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month.\xa0\n\nLucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I\'ll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.\n\nKeep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.\n\nCOSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH\n\nBEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types\n\nKEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid\n\nPRICE: $19\n\nABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.\n\nAbout My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts\n\nMy skin can be unpredictable. But, as I\'ve gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.\xa0\xa0\n\nIngredients: One key, familiar ingredient\xa0\n\nThe tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.\n\nThe Feel: Like a bandage\n\nYou can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Packaging: Easy to store\n\nThe 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish\n\nI placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.\n\nEven with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn\'t budge overnight.\n\nIf you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn\'t expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn\'t gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don\'t believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Value: Worth it\n\nWas this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nSimilar Products: You\'ve got options\xa0\n\nsquish.

I like this product so much better than the stars and will never go back. These come with 2 sizes in the package, small ones for during the day that are inconspicuous enough to wear out without everyone noticing, and a slightly larger version for overnight.

Keep reading for our full product review.\xa0\n\nEditor’s Note: We reviewed this article on September 24, 2023. As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.\n\nPeriod, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren\'t blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month.\xa0\n\nLucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I\'ll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.\n\nKeep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.\n\nCOSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH\n\nBEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types\n\nKEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid\n\nPRICE: $19\n\nABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.\n\nAbout My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts\n\nMy skin can be unpredictable. But, as I\'ve gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.\xa0\xa0\n\nIngredients: One key, familiar ingredient\xa0\n\nThe tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.\n\nThe Feel: Like a bandage\n\nYou can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Packaging: Easy to store\n\nThe 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish\n\nI placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.\n\nEven with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn\'t budge overnight.\n\nIf you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn\'t expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn\'t gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don\'t believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Value: Worth it\n\nWas this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nSimilar Products: You\'ve got options\xa0\n\nsquish. Flower Power Acne Patches ($14): This pack of 20 floral hydrocolloid pimple patches to help zap blemishes overnight and let\'s face it, they\'re pretty darn cute. Pimple, but make them pretty.\xa0\n\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Variety Pack ($7): These 36 count medical-grade, chemical-free, allergy-tested patches stay put no matter how much you toss and turn throughout the night.\xa0\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nIf you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won\'t regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.\n\n The 15 Best Acne Spot Treatments to Zap Pimples Fast\nSpecs\nPRODUCT NAME\nAcne Pimple Master Patch\nPRODUCT BRAND\nCOSRX\nPRICE\n$19.00\nWEIGHT\n0.1 oz.\nINCLUDED\n24 acne patches, in 3 different sizes\nINGREDIENTS\nCellulose gum, Styrene Isoprene Styrene Block Copolymer, Polysobutylene, Petroleum Resin, Polyurethane Film, Liquid Paraffin, Tetrakis Methane.\nRelated Stories\n  \n\nI Tried Kiehl’s Viral "Liquid Pimple Patch" on My Hormonal Breakout\n\n  \n\nLive by Acne Patches?

It may have been stored somewhere with moisture, but they still looked new, so I will still be using them. I love that they have a variety of sizes in this pack came with a lot. I typically use a different brand, but they were not available online. Good overall.\n3 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tAnonymous\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n I wish I had these when I was a teen!\nReviewed in the United States on September 5, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nThese are amazing. I wish I had them when I was a teen with embarrassing acne. Now I have an occasional blemish, and this takes care of it in no time. I put a patch on before bed, and it has never come off while I was sleeping. I also have somewhat sensitive skin, and this has never caused any redness. I highly recommend them.\n2 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tAshley Stanton\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n A product that actually does what it advertises\nReviewed in the United States on July 17, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nI\'ve been using these patches for over 5 years now and they have never let me down! They are a constant staple in my skincare routine. They cover up unsightly breakouts while dealing with the problem below the surface (drawing the oil/puss from the breakout and expelling it from your skin). They are easy to apply, can last for over 24 hours on skin, and appear sheer on your skin if you need to wear in public. I typically like to put them on at night after my skincare routine before I go to bed and remove in the morning and will repeat until the breakout is gone. The variety size pack is great so you can tailor to the size of your breakout. There are a lot of these products on the market but these are by far the best and affordable too!\n4 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tJM\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Funciona!\nReviewed in the United States on September 5, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nAyuda a ir eliminando esos granitos que no deseamos.\nHelpful\nReport\nTranslate review to English\n\tAmazon Customer\n4.0 out of 5 stars\n Love them?\nReviewed in the United States on April 27, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nI don’t know how I feel about these, but I keep using them. There is white stuff on them every time I pull them off so they’re pulling something out of king skin, but my acne isn’t necessarily gone for a couple days still. But I feel like they work better than acne cream so would still recommend. Does leave a stick residue I don’t love, but stays on during sleep so I guess it needs to be pretty sticky\nOne person found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tCarrie\n4.0 out of 5 stars\n Pleasantly surprised to report that this helps! If you\'re on the fence, try them!\nReviewed in the United States on February 7, 2021\nVerified Purchase\nI often have acne that flares up and when one goes away, at least one more shows up next door. I expected that to be the case with these, but that did not happen. As I have put the patches on. The acne decreases and nothing pops up to replace it.\n\nI have sensitive skin and I was worried about a possible reaction to the adhesive, but I haven\'t seen anything like that. I have used them on the same spots multiple days in a row for deep acne and have still not seen any negative reactions. As for the deep acne, it is practically gone and no longer painful to the touch.\n\nAs a test, I had two white heads pop up on the same day. I handled one the way I normally would and the other with a patch. The one with the patch is practically gone the next morning and the one that I handled still looks angry and red.\n\nA huge bonus for me is that these patches reduce my likelihood of picking at my acne while it works on reducing them.\n\nI would recommend using them at night because I found myself getting impatient with them, particularly the ones high on my cheeks or on my nose because I could see them sometimes. By leaving them on overnight, they didn\'t bother me while I was sleeping.\n\nWith my flare ups, I can easily use a full sheet in two or three days, which is somewhat concerning given how long flares can last and that there are only four sheets in a package.\n\nI will say that the patches don\'t always stick the first time depending on which part of my face I put them on, and I haven\'t seen hardly any results from the smallest patches. I am also still figuring out the best way to moisturize the rest of my face without disturbing the patches.\n\nDespite those slight issues. I will continue to use these to combat my acne because I have seen results overnight, and they have improved my overall skin health.\nHelpful\nReport\n\tekUTOPIA\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Thin and Works!\nReviewed in the United States on July 13, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nExactly the same as what a got from physical beauty stores but way cheaper.

Spaitis\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Works great!\nReviewed in the United States on October 15, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nI have used a similar star shaped product several times and decided to try derma Angel instead this time, and I’m so glad I did! I like this product so much better than the stars and will never go back. These come with 2 sizes in the package, small ones for during the day that are inconspicuous enough to wear out without everyone noticing, and a slightly larger version for overnight. These have consistently stayed put where I stick them and reliably work overnight. They are clear, but turn white where they have sucked out the moisture from your blemish, so you can literally see how well they’ve worked while you were sleeping. If I notice a blemish forming, I put this on and go to bed, and the lump and soreness are gone in the morning. Amazing!\nHelpful\nReport\n\tScott\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n It Works!\nReviewed in the United States on October 12, 2023\nPattern Name: Intensive-2 Size/96 CountVerified Purchase\nI wasn’t sure about this product but it did work and fast! It takes care of blemishes overnight. No fuss or mess. Simply clean the affected area and put one of these patches on overnight and see the results in the morning.

I was looking for a more affordable option that was thin for daytime use while also being effective. I also tend to get cystic acne that hangs around, so quantity was also important. This fit the bill! I love how it comes with two sizes. It is also really thin and surprised at how easily it blends into my skin compared to others I have tried. I like how this one also contains salicylic acid for stubborn acne that needs to be dried out. My only complaint was that the sticker can be hard to remove from the backing. The perforated lines don’t really tear. It may get easier as I get used to it, but wasn’t super intuitive in the beginning.\n4 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tMeadow\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Helped reduce redness!\nReviewed in the United States on October 16, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nThis product was great getting to work on my skin overnight and it was so satisfying to look at the patch when finished!\nHelpful\nReport\n\tAnish Kumar\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Helps\nReviewed in the United States on September 25, 2023\nPattern Name: Intensive-2 Size/132 CountVerified Purchase\nIt takes few of the first patches to get used to putting on the right spot but after a while it is easy. Wasted almost 15 or 20 just trying to get used to it. But the product works. It\'s not a right away fix but helps effectively and takes few days.\nHelpful\nReport\n\tKristen\n4.0 out of 5 stars\n Great patches!\nReviewed in the United States on September 18, 2023\nPattern Name: Intensive-2 Size/132 CountVerified Purchase\nGreat patches! They are basically invisible on the face and work really well. I got the intensive ones and do feel they are better than regular strength. I like the perforation on the patches to keep from pulling them off with fingernails, which makes the sides lift up once applied to the face.\n2 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tAbfab KC\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n They work great!\nReviewed in the United States on October 16, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nThey work great & you can barely see them.\nHelpful\nReport\nSee more reviews\n\nDisclaimer: While we work to ensure that product information is correct, on occasion manufacturers may alter their ingredient lists.

It has a gel layer that’s formulated with pectin or gelatin and other ingredients that attract water and absorb fluids (such as pus). Mighty Patch is not made with gelatin and therefore is vegan-friendly. As the hydrocolloid draws in fluids or pus, the patch changes from transparent to opaque white, which is all the gunk that was pulled from the pimple. Read more about hydrocolloid and how it works here.\n\nHow do I use Mighty Patch?\n\nMighty Patch is a gentle (yet super-effective) pimple patch. To be exact, it’s a transparent hydrocolloid sticker that sucks up pus and protects the skin.\n\nFirst, thoroughly clean and dry the blemish and surrounding area. Apply a Mighty Patch directly on top of the blemish and leave it on until the sticker turns opaque white, which generally takes about six hours. If there is still pus left in the pimple after your patch is removed, you can replace it with a new patch. Mighty Patch is safe to use overnight or during the day.\n\nWhat kind of pimple is Mighty Patch designed for?\n\nSince hydrocolloid attracts water and fluid, Mighty Patch works best on pimples that have come to a head (in other words, you can see white fluid or pus trapped in the pimple). If you tried a Mighty Patch and it didn’t change from transparent to opaque white, your pimple might not have been “mature” enough or the right type of blemish.\n\nIf you have cystic acne, we recommend you see a doctor or dermatologist for professional treatment.\n\nWhat’s the difference between Mighty Patch Original, Invisible+ and Surface?\n\nMighty Patch Original is the Hero Cosmetics OG. It’s our nighttime patch and comes in one size. Mighty Patch Invisible+ is ultra thin and has tapered edges that seamlessly blend into your skin, making it perfect for daytime use. Mighty Patch Surfaceis best for cluster (or large area) breakouts (e.g., along the jawline, cheeks and forehead).\n\nIs the Mighty Patch safe to use alongside acne prescription medication?\n\nWe recommend you consult your doctor before using any prescription drugs with Mighty Patch.\n\nWhat\'s the maximum length of time I should wear a patch?\n\nIf you\'ve worn the patch for over 6 hours and it hasn\'t absorbed anything, it can mean a few things:\n\n- The pimple does not have fluid in it so it\'s not "ripe" yet or not the right type of pimple\n- The pimple does have fluid in it but the fluid is deep in the pore. The patch can help coax the fluid to the surface and then coax it out but this will take 1-3 days depending on how deep the fluid is.\n- The patch needs easier access to the fluid. Some customers have seen that popping or pricking the pimple can help draw out the fluid faster onto the patch.\n\nWe advise you wear the patch for 6-8 hours or until the patch has absorbed the gunk out, whichever is first. If after 6-8 hours, the patch has not absorbed anything, please see above. Let us know if you have other questions!\n\nHere\'s a blog article that explains the reasons why the patch may not have worked and how to fix it.\n\nHow is Mighty Patch different from other acne solutions?\n\nNo harsh chemicals or formulas that dry out skin\nWon’t irritate sensitive skin\nActs as a protective barrier against germs and bacteria\nPrevents touching and picking, which can worsen blemishes or cause scarring\nVisibly shows that it’s working by changing from transparent to white\nEasy to use, small, light and portable\n100% safe and FDA-approved\nSafe for pregnant women and nursing moms\n\nWhat do I do after I take off my patch?\n\nFirst, wash your skin using a low pH-cleanser, followed by an exfoliator. After skin is dry, use a moisturizer to nourish your skin. Read more about post-patch care here.\n\nIs Mighty Patch cruelty-free?\n\nYes! Mighty Patch is cruelty-free and vegan-friendly as well as latex free. We do not test on animals in any country, nor do we work with suppliers or manufacturers that test on animals. The products we create represent our values, including the belief that animals should not be hurt at the expense of good skin.\n\nIs Mighty Patch safe for pregnant women and nursing moms?\n\nYes! Mighty Patch is not formulated with harsh chemicals, so it\'s the perfect acne spot treatment for pregnant women. We interviewed dermatologist Dr. Jenny Liu during her pregnancy, and she recommended Mighty Patch as a safe treatment for pregnant women. Read the interview on our blog here.\n\nThat being said, we suggest confirming with your doctor since every pregnancy is different.\n\nYou might also like\nGo to Rescue Balm\n\nRescue Balm\n\nThe post-blemish recovery cream\n\n5 ml\n15 ml\n50 ml\n$12.99\nAdd to Cart\nSAVE 10%\nGo to Clear Collective Trio\n\nClear Collective Trio\n\nThe AM/PM routine\n\n$35\n$38.97\nAdd to Cart\nGo to Superlight Sunscreen SPF 30\n\nSuperlight Sunscreen SPF 30\n\nThe SPF for acne-prone skin\n\n10 ml\n50 ml\n$19.99\nAdd to Cart\nGo to Micropoint™ for Blemishes\n\nMicropoint™ for Blemishes\n\nThe early-stage blemish patch\n\n$12.99\nAdd to Cart\nStay in touch for monthly newsletters, new products, and deals.\nYour email address\nShop\nPimple Care + Aftercare\nSensitive Skin\nBlackheads + Pores\nDark Spots + Post-Blemish Care\nDaily Care\nHero Cosmetics\nOffers\nRewards\nSkin School\nAbout Us\nJoin Skin Squad\nHelp\nFAQ\nReturns\nRetailers\nInternational\nContact Us\nInfo\nPress\nCareers\nWholesale\nAffiliates\nQuestions?\nContact us.\nReturns\nPrivacy\nTerms\nCookies Settings\nHero Cosmetics © 2023\nYour Cart\n0 items\n$0.00\nRecommended for you\nGo to Mighty Patch™ Original patch\nMighty Patch™ Original patch\n36 Count\n$12.99\nAdd to Cart\nYour cart is empty\nDiscount is copied\nHeads up, redeeming points for a discount reward is non-reversible.\n\nDiscount codes cannot be applied to carts with other discounts, promotions, or subscriptions.\nRedeem\nCookie Notice\n\nChurch & Dwight and its partners use cookies to enhance your online experience, and personalize the content and ads to your interests.

But for emergency, i use bandaids/acne patches to cover the most offending spot. It\'s quite effective for me, since the patch keep my hands away, conceal the redness, while also suck the liquid inside those acnes out without the need to pop them and thus, reduce the swelling. But, i need to change it several times a day. After 3-4 days of acne patches, the swelling part usually gonna get pretty tame.\nBut again, what work for me might not work for you.\n(Juust a disclaimer, I\'m no doctor and this is not a medical advice )\n\n\nBad Storm said: ↑\nhehehe i never an acne phase in my life \nYou\'re a good doggo so you don\'t get one! \n\xa0\nFulminata, Oct 13, 2021\n#18\nBad Storm likes this.\nSaorihirai\nWell-Known Member\nJoined:\nApr 18, 2020\nMessages:\n555\nLikes Received:\n564\nReading List:\nLink\ndon\'t have any, if I do get it I guess I just ignore it.

I put a patch on before bed, and it has never come off while I was sleeping. I also have somewhat sensitive skin, and this has never caused any redness.

They are a constant staple in my skincare routine. They cover up unsightly breakouts while dealing with the problem below the surface (drawing the oil/puss from the breakout and expelling it from your skin). They are easy to apply, can last for over 24 hours on skin, and appear sheer on your skin if you need to wear in public. I typically like to put them on at night after my skincare routine before I go to bed and remove in the morning and will repeat until the breakout is gone. The variety size pack is great so you can tailor to the size of your breakout. There are a lot of these products on the market but these are by far the best and affordable too!\n4 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tJM\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Funciona!\nReviewed in the United States on September 5, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nAyuda a ir eliminando esos granitos que no deseamos.\nHelpful\nReport\nTranslate review to English\n\tAmazon Customer\n4.0 out of 5 stars\n Love them?\nReviewed in the United States on April 27, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nI don’t know how I feel about these, but I keep using them.

If you\'re on the fence, try them!\nReviewed in the United States on February 7, 2021\nVerified Purchase\nI often have acne that flares up and when one goes away, at least one more shows up next door. I expected that to be the case with these, but that did not happen. As I have put the patches on. The acne decreases and nothing pops up to replace it.\n\nI have sensitive skin and I was worried about a possible reaction to the adhesive, but I haven\'t seen anything like that. I have used them on the same spots multiple days in a row for deep acne and have still not seen any negative reactions. As for the deep acne, it is practically gone and no longer painful to the touch.\n\nAs a test, I had two white heads pop up on the same day. I handled one the way I normally would and the other with a patch. The one with the patch is practically gone the next morning and the one that I handled still looks angry and red.\n\nA huge bonus for me is that these patches reduce my likelihood of picking at my acne while it works on reducing them.\n\nI would recommend using them at night because I found myself getting impatient with them, particularly the ones high on my cheeks or on my nose because I could see them sometimes. By leaving them on overnight, they didn\'t bother me while I was sleeping.\n\nWith my flare ups, I can easily use a full sheet in two or three days, which is somewhat concerning given how long flares can last and that there are only four sheets in a package.\n\nI will say that the patches don\'t always stick the first time depending on which part of my face I put them on, and I haven\'t seen hardly any results from the smallest patches. I am also still figuring out the best way to moisturize the rest of my face without disturbing the patches.\n\nDespite those slight issues. I will continue to use these to combat my acne because I have seen results overnight, and they have improved my overall skin health.\nHelpful\nReport\n\tekUTOPIA\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Thin and Works!\nReviewed in the United States on July 13, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nExactly the same as what a got from physical beauty stores but way cheaper.

It has a gel layer that’s formulated with pectin or gelatin and other ingredients that attract water and absorb fluids (such as pus). Mighty Patch is not made with gelatin and therefore is vegan-friendly. As the hydrocolloid draws in fluids or pus, the patch changes from transparent to opaque white, which is all the gunk that was pulled from the pimple. Read more about hydrocolloid and how it works here.\n\nHow do I use Mighty Patch?\n\nMighty Patch is a gentle (yet super-effective) pimple patch. To be exact, it’s a transparent hydrocolloid sticker that sucks up pus and protects the skin.\n\nFirst, thoroughly clean and dry the blemish and surrounding area. Apply a Mighty Patch directly on top of the blemish and leave it on until the sticker turns opaque white, which generally takes about six hours. If there is still pus left in the pimple after your patch is removed, you can replace it with a new patch. Mighty Patch is safe to use overnight or during the day.\n\nWhat kind of pimple is Mighty Patch designed for?\n\nSince hydrocolloid attracts water and fluid, Mighty Patch works best on pimples that have come to a head (in other words, you can see white fluid or pus trapped in the pimple). If you tried a Mighty Patch and it didn’t change from transparent to opaque white, your pimple might not have been “mature” enough or the right type of blemish.\n\nIf you have cystic acne, we recommend you see a doctor or dermatologist for professional treatment.\n\nWhat’s the difference between Mighty Patch Original, Invisible+ and Surface?\n\nMighty Patch Original is the Hero Cosmetics OG. It’s our nighttime patch and comes in one size. Mighty Patch Invisible+ is ultra thin and has tapered edges that seamlessly blend into your skin, making it perfect for daytime use. Mighty Patch Surfaceis best for cluster (or large area) breakouts (e.g., along the jawline, cheeks and forehead).\n\nIs the Mighty Patch safe to use alongside acne prescription medication?\n\nWe recommend you consult your doctor before using any prescription drugs with Mighty Patch.\n\nWhat\'s the maximum length of time I should wear a patch?\n\nIf you\'ve worn the patch for over 6 hours and it hasn\'t absorbed anything, it can mean a few things:\n\n- The pimple does not have fluid in it so it\'s not "ripe" yet or not the right type of pimple\n- The pimple does have fluid in it but the fluid is deep in the pore. The patch can help coax the fluid to the surface and then coax it out but this will take 1-3 days depending on how deep the fluid is.\n- The patch needs easier access to the fluid. Some customers have seen that popping or pricking the pimple can help draw out the fluid faster onto the patch.\n\nWe advise you wear the patch for 6-8 hours or until the patch has absorbed the gunk out, whichever is first. If after 6-8 hours, the patch has not absorbed anything, please see above. Let us know if you have other questions!\n\nHere\'s a blog article that explains the reasons why the patch may not have worked and how to fix it.\n\nHow is Mighty Patch different from other acne solutions?\n\nNo harsh chemicals or formulas that dry out skin\nWon’t irritate sensitive skin\nActs as a protective barrier against germs and bacteria\nPrevents touching and picking, which can worsen blemishes or cause scarring\nVisibly shows that it’s working by changing from transparent to white\nEasy to use, small, light and portable\n100% safe and FDA-approved\nSafe for pregnant women and nursing moms\n\nWhat do I do after I take off my patch?\n\nFirst, wash your skin using a low pH-cleanser, followed by an exfoliator. After skin is dry, use a moisturizer to nourish your skin. Read more about post-patch care here.\n\nIs Mighty Patch cruelty-free?\n\nYes! Mighty Patch is cruelty-free and vegan-friendly as well as latex free. We do not test on animals in any country, nor do we work with suppliers or manufacturers that test on animals. The products we create represent our values, including the belief that animals should not be hurt at the expense of good skin.\n\nIs Mighty Patch safe for pregnant women and nursing moms?\n\nYes! Mighty Patch is not formulated with harsh chemicals, so it\'s the perfect acne spot treatment for pregnant women. We interviewed dermatologist Dr. Jenny Liu during her pregnancy, and she recommended Mighty Patch as a safe treatment for pregnant women. Read the interview on our blog here.\n\nThat being said, we suggest confirming with your doctor since every pregnancy is different.\n\nYou might also like\nGo to Rescue Balm\n\nRescue Balm\n\nThe post-blemish recovery cream\n\n5 ml\n15 ml\n50 ml\n$12.99\nAdd to Cart\nSAVE 10%\nGo to Clear Collective Trio\n\nClear Collective Trio\n\nThe AM/PM routine\n\n$35\n$38.97\nAdd to Cart\nGo to Superlight Sunscreen SPF 30\n\nSuperlight Sunscreen SPF 30\n\nThe SPF for acne-prone skin\n\n10 ml\n50 ml\n$19.99\nAdd to Cart\nGo to Micropoint™ for Blemishes\n\nMicropoint™ for Blemishes\n\nThe early-stage blemish patch\n\n$12.99\nAdd to Cart\nStay in touch for monthly newsletters, new products, and deals.\nYour email address\nShop\nPimple Care + Aftercare\nSensitive Skin\nBlackheads + Pores\nDark Spots + Post-Blemish Care\nDaily Care\nHero Cosmetics\nOffers\nRewards\nSkin School\nAbout Us\nJoin Skin Squad\nHelp\nFAQ\nReturns\nRetailers\nInternational\nContact Us\nInfo\nPress\nCareers\nWholesale\nAffiliates\nQuestions?\nContact us.\nReturns\nPrivacy\nTerms\nCookies Settings\nHero Cosmetics © 2023\nYour Cart\n0 items\n$0.00\nRecommended for you\nGo to Mighty Patch™ Original patch\nMighty Patch™ Original patch\n36 Count\n$12.99\nAdd to Cart\nYour cart is empty\nDiscount is copied\nHeads up, redeeming points for a discount reward is non-reversible.\n\nDiscount codes cannot be applied to carts with other discounts, promotions, or subscriptions.\nRedeem\nCookie Notice\n\nChurch & Dwight and its partners use cookies to enhance your online experience, and personalize the content and ads to your interests.

It may have been stored somewhere with moisture, but they still looked new, so I will still be using them. I love that they have a variety of sizes in this pack came with a lot.

I wish I had them when I was a teen with embarrassing acne. Now I have an occasional blemish, and this takes care of it in no time. I put a patch on before bed, and it has never come off while I was sleeping. I also have somewhat sensitive skin, and this has never caused any redness. I highly recommend them.\n2 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tAshley Stanton\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n A product that actually does what it advertises\nReviewed in the United States on July 17, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nI\'ve been using these patches for over 5 years now and they have never let me down! They are a constant staple in my skincare routine. They cover up unsightly breakouts while dealing with the problem below the surface (drawing the oil/puss from the breakout and expelling it from your skin). They are easy to apply, can last for over 24 hours on skin, and appear sheer on your skin if you need to wear in public. I typically like to put them on at night after my skincare routine before I go to bed and remove in the morning and will repeat until the breakout is gone. The variety size pack is great so you can tailor to the size of your breakout. There are a lot of these products on the market but these are by far the best and affordable too!\n4 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tJM\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Funciona!\nReviewed in the United States on September 5, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nAyuda a ir eliminando esos granitos que no deseamos.\nHelpful\nReport\nTranslate review to English\n\tAmazon Customer\n4.0 out of 5 stars\n Love them?\nReviewed in the United States on April 27, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nI don’t know how I feel about these, but I keep using them. There is white stuff on them every time I pull them off so they’re pulling something out of king skin, but my acne isn’t necessarily gone for a couple days still. But I feel like they work better than acne cream so would still recommend. Does leave a stick residue I don’t love, but stays on during sleep so I guess it needs to be pretty sticky\nOne person found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tCarrie\n4.0 out of 5 stars\n Pleasantly surprised to report that this helps! If you\'re on the fence, try them!\nReviewed in the United States on February 7, 2021\nVerified Purchase\nI often have acne that flares up and when one goes away, at least one more shows up next door. I expected that to be the case with these, but that did not happen. As I have put the patches on. The acne decreases and nothing pops up to replace it.\n\nI have sensitive skin and I was worried about a possible reaction to the adhesive, but I haven\'t seen anything like that. I have used them on the same spots multiple days in a row for deep acne and have still not seen any negative reactions. As for the deep acne, it is practically gone and no longer painful to the touch.\n\nAs a test, I had two white heads pop up on the same day. I handled one the way I normally would and the other with a patch. The one with the patch is practically gone the next morning and the one that I handled still looks angry and red.\n\nA huge bonus for me is that these patches reduce my likelihood of picking at my acne while it works on reducing them.\n\nI would recommend using them at night because I found myself getting impatient with them, particularly the ones high on my cheeks or on my nose because I could see them sometimes. By leaving them on overnight, they didn\'t bother me while I was sleeping.\n\nWith my flare ups, I can easily use a full sheet in two or three days, which is somewhat concerning given how long flares can last and that there are only four sheets in a package.\n\nI will say that the patches don\'t always stick the first time depending on which part of my face I put them on, and I haven\'t seen hardly any results from the smallest patches. I am also still figuring out the best way to moisturize the rest of my face without disturbing the patches.\n\nDespite those slight issues. I will continue to use these to combat my acne because I have seen results overnight, and they have improved my overall skin health.\nHelpful\nReport\n\tekUTOPIA\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Thin and Works!\nReviewed in the United States on July 13, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nExactly the same as what a got from physical beauty stores but way cheaper. It\'s so thin so it won\'t be too obvious when I wear it out, and it can prevent me to keep touching the inflaming area.
