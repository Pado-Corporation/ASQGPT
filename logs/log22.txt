Great!! Tips for oily peeps
Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2023
These work wonders! This is my second time buying them and one pack lasted me almost a year (only occasional use not daily). If you have oily skin I recommend using one of those nose pore strips on the area first and that helps with drying it out so these patches can stick well. Even with super oily skin they adhere wonderfully with that method!

 Shocked at the results, lots of gunk, smaller bumps
Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2022
Verified Purchase
So I got these patches in the mail yesterday (I know it might be a little too soon to write a review) but I wanted to try these right away because of the amount of oil/acne/clogged pores that is on both my forehead and nose. So I have a very oily forehead and even if I wash my face in the morning it’s already so shiny you can see your reflection by mid afternoon. Plus I have a whole bunch of bumps that cover my forehead and it’s been really red lately. My nose just has a lot of clogged pores and I am really tired of trying those pore strips that just really damage your skin. So last night after washing my face very thoroughly I decided to put two patches on my forehead and one patch on my nose. After sleeping with the patches on my face, I took them off this morning and I was shocked at the results. The amount of gunk/oil that the patches had pulled out of my forehead and my nose was incredible. Pulling the patch off of my nose didn’t even hurt and actually my nose still felt really smooth, plus it actually cleared out some of my pores which I was really really happy about. The patches on my forehead actually removed a lot of the access oil that was still left over after washing my face. I did take an after photo of my forehead but I don’t have a before photo of my foreheads so there is no comparison, but I can say that my forehead does look less red and I feel like there are less bumps/they feel a lot smaller. I definitely recommend these patches for milder acne or for excess oil build up in your skin that can cause said acne. Usually I would use the small round patches on the volcanic white heads that I get on my face so that way I can safely remove The acne without damaging my skin.
I will need to figure out how to make the bumps on my forehead go away because I know that these patches alone won’t be able to do it and exfoliation alone has not worked for me so I think a combination of the patches plus other skin care products in my routine can work. I usually wear the patches overnight but I’m not sure if everybody else does that. Of course I will need to do better skin care since I am terrible at taking care of my own skin but as I use these patches more often and I will try to update this review and post the results. I hope people considering these patches can find this review helpful.

 They work
Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2023

They do work really well. The only complaint I have is that since they don’t have the seal around the patch, it tends to lift if you sweat or get that area, wet and it’s annoying to have to push it back down, because if you don’t, then it’ll start to peel off a little by little. Maybe that’s something they can change.

We put The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch to the test after receiving a complimentary sample from the brand. Keep reading for our full product review. 

Editor’s Note: We reviewed this article on September 24, 2023. As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.

Period, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren't blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month. 

Lucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I'll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.

Keep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.

COSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH

BEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types

KEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid

PRICE: $19

ABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.

About My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts

My skin can be unpredictable. But, as I've gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.  

Ingredients: One key, familiar ingredient 

The tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.

The Feel: Like a bandage

You can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Packaging: Easy to store

The 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish

I placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.

Even with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn't budge overnight.

If you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn't expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn't gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don't believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Value: Worth it

Was this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

Similar Products: You've got options 

squish. Flower Power Acne Patches ($14): This pack of 20 floral hydrocolloid pimple patches to help zap blemishes overnight and let's face it, they're pretty darn cute. Pimple, but make them pretty. 

Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Variety Pack ($7): These 36 count medical-grade, chemical-free, allergy-tested patches stay put no matter how much you toss and turn throughout the night. 

Final Verdict

If you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won't regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.

The best pimple patches that I've used - Invisible, stays on, thin yet flexible
Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2023
I have tried a few brands of pimple patches, including big names found at the drugstore and internet knock-offs. This is by far my favorite for the standard pimple patch.

Pros
- Patches stay on for a long time but are easy to remove
- Patch is thin yet flexible so can conform to a high/tall pimple but stay invisible
- Sheet has tear away backing strips that improve the unpeeling of the patch so that the patch doesn't get damaged/warped before the application process

Cons
- Not a lot of size options
- Not the cheapest
- The multi-sheet box does not come with a resealable pouch
Standard

Tip:
- Buy the version with the resealable pouch and put the open sleeves of patches in the pouch

Very sticky
Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2023
I spent about a week looking at different pimple patch brands, reading the comments, and comparing prices until I finally decided on this brand. The delivery was fast, arrived the next day. I immediately used one because I had a big pimple on my cheek. First thing I noticed was how sticky the patches are. There are three rows of patches per plastic sheet, and the plastic is perforated at each row. This allows you to tear the plastic, thereby lifting the patch off of it and making it easier to grab. If you just try to peel one off the plastic, the edges will curl and you will not be able to uncurl them because they are SO sticky. The patches themselves seem to have a smaller 'active area' than the actual diameter of the patch. The efficacy of the patches is not a good as other brands I've tried. Although it did pull out some sebum/pus, I had to used about 4 of these patches for a pimple that I only would have used 2 using a different brand patch. When it came time to remove the patches, they were so sticky it was actually a bit uncomfortable to remove. I don't think these would be good for people with sensitive skin. It also felt like it left a sticky residue behind, which I did not experience with other brands. All in all, I won't be repurchasing these.

TL;DR
Very sticky, probably not good for sensitive skin. Leaves behind sticky residue on skin. Would not buy again.

- Sheet has tear away backing strips that improve the unpeeling of the patch so that the patch doesn't get damaged/warped before the application process

Cons
- Not a lot of size options
- Not the cheapest
- The multi-sheet box does not come with a resealable pouch
Standard

Tip:
- Buy the version with the resealable pouch and put the open sleeves of patches in the pouch

 Pretty decent

These decrease redness significantly. I’m still learning how to use them, but for some spots will require 2 patches worth of wearing to get pus out. They are not hard to spot but not very explicit either. Wearing on face you could see them in spots where you move a lot but if they’re on your back and you’re wearing a tank, they’re not extremely visible. They can also be worn through a shower, but they do slightly peel on the edges with friction. Would definitely buy again to continue to see how continuously effective they are for skin health. In some places they stick so well it hurts to peel them off, but not always. Also, there are two different sizes.

 These really work!
Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2023
Size: 96 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
Love these so much, and have repurchased them multiple times.
For baseline: I deal with adult hormonal acne (non cystic) and obsessive skin picking
tl;dr -- non-medicated; soothing; love the shape and sizing; help me cope with skin picking; great value

Picked these up because other brands are waaay to expensive (not naming names but >$12 for 30 patches? No way) AND these are non-medicated. While I wouldn't say my skin is "sensitive" to most products, tea tree has never agreed with it; I've tried medicated patches and ended up with inflamed, irritated bumps and red rings all over my face... ew. These though? Smooth, clear, no irritation in sight!
The adhesion is great -- like others have said, I've showered with these on and worn them overnight with no issue. On top of that, these really stay down -- I've worn them under glasses and masks for 6+ hours without them peeling up. I usually have issues with sticky/gummy sensations on my face, but these don't give me that icky feeling, not even after hours of wear.
I prefer these to the 'overnight' versions they sell because these have a tapered edge (edges are thinner and the center is thicker VS 'overnight' type which are all one thickness). The added thickness in the center is really nice because it cushions any blemishes; again, can wear these for hours without feeling masks/glasses bump and rub against the blemish spot itself. I'm really sensitive to pain and itching which triggers my obsessive skin picking. Using these patches has cut that almost entirely because (1) I can't reach the spot to pick, (2) it cushions it so I don't feel any irritation, (3) is extremely satisfying to peel off after 6+ hours (which reduces the emotional need to pick).
My skin is the clearest it's been in years, and while I wouldn't say it's only because of these, the patches have definitely helped me reduce scarring/spreading when I do get mature whitehead pimples.
Besides my face, I have used these before for small needle scars (medical testing and blood donations) and they really help protect and prevent/soften scarring, so double win there too!

 Works well but not an overnight solution

It took a few days of using these patches to get my pimple to calm down. It’s not an overnight solution but I think it made my pimple go way quicker than if I weren’t to use anything. It’s pretty skin tone on my light/medium skin and sometimes I forget it’s there.

Easy. Just put them on and go to bed. Wake up the next day and breakouts are much less inflamed, or cleared up all together. I suppose it I suppose it’s also satisfying to pull it off, and it looks like it absorbed toxins or whatever.

This is the best brand and type I have found so far for this product. I use them all the time and they are fantastic. I almost never have breakouts anymore because as soon as I feel it coming these will get rid of it!

 Truly the most invisible patches

You truly could wear these out as I have to intentionally look very closely to see them on my skin. They’re tapered incredibly well besides these generally work well. Nice.

How did I only discover these in my 30s?!! Tried other brands and these are best hands down. Practically invisible…until they get the gunk…and they do, unlike others. Making sure I have these stocked for myself and kids!

 Effortless Skin Care for Busy Parents
Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2023
Size: 96 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
As a busy dad of three little ones, finding a skin care product that works quickly and stays put throughout the day is a lifesaver. These hydrocolloid patches not only gently draw out the impurities from my skin, but they also blend seamlessly and stay in place all day, even amidst the chaos of parenting!

Loved the size and ease of application. I’ve used ones that are shaped like hearts and flowers from other companies… totally annoying! These you could barely notice. It was like magic when I put them on.
