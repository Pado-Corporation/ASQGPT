We put The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch to the test after receiving a complimentary sample from the brand. Keep reading for our full product review. 

Editor’s Note: We reviewed this article on September 24, 2023. As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.

Period, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren't blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month. 

Lucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I'll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.

Keep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.

COSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH

BEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types

KEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid

PRICE: $19

ABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.

About My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts

My skin can be unpredictable. But, as I've gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.  

Ingredients: One key, familiar ingredient 

The tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.

The Feel: Like a bandage

You can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Packaging: Easy to store

The 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish

I placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.

Even with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn't budge overnight.

If you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn't expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn't gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don't believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Value: Worth it

Was this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

Similar Products: You've got options 

squish. Flower Power Acne Patches ($14): This pack of 20 floral hydrocolloid pimple patches to help zap blemishes overnight and let's face it, they're pretty darn cute. Pimple, but make them pretty. 

Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Variety Pack ($7): These 36 count medical-grade, chemical-free, allergy-tested patches stay put no matter how much you toss and turn throughout the night. 

Final Verdict

If you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won't regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.

BYRDIE / JACLYN MASTROPASQUA

There's no shortage of over-the-counter products for clearing breakouts. But when you only have one or two zits at any given time, there's no need to treat your entire face. Enter the pimple patch, a targeted way to zap acne without exposing the rest of your skin to undue drying or irritation. According to board-certified dermatologist Sheilagh Maguiness, MD, acne patches typically contain hydrocolloid gel,1 which is often used in wound care. Hydrocolloid patches are able to keep the spot moist in order to accelerate healing and protect. In addition to healing blemishes, Dr. Maguiness notes, "The hydrocolloid in the acne sticker can help absorb sebum and dirt." 

Claire Wolinsky, MD, a New York dermatologist specializing in facial rejuvenation, says she loves pimple patches and recommends them frequently: "One reason they are particularly helpful in treating acne is because once covered, patients can't pick or squeeze their pimple, which reduces the risk of infection and bacteria." And with less trauma to the skin, Dr. Wolinsky says you're less likely to experience scarring or discoloration.

We conducted hours of research on the best acne patches, evaluating each on active ingredients to target acne as well as ingredients to soothe skin and prevent redness. We also looked at things like how easy they are to apply and how well they stay on. After considering dozens of brands and consulting with two celebrity dermatologists, we landed on the following best in show.

What We Like

Reduces redness

Soothes inflammation

Contains skin-clearing ingredients

What We Don't Like

Only one size

Celebrity aesthetician Joshua Ross of SkinLab stands behind Peace Out Acne Healing Dots. "They employ hydrocolloid2 technology that helps extract impurities and guards against external elements," he explains. What's more, the patches create a barrier between pimples and your bacteria-laden fingers while delivering a time-released infusion of ingredients.

Cosmetic nurse Kristina Kitsos is also a fan of Peace Out. "They contain salicylic acid,3 which penetrates pores to target acne blemishes and blackheads," she tells Byrdie. Additionally, Kitsos appreciates that these acne patches contain soothing aloe vera to minimize redness and skin-clearing standby vitamin A (aka retinol).4 She says that since they're formulated with hydrating ingredients, the skin is able to heal quicker and better than if a drying, alcohol formula was used.

Who It's For

If you have skin that dries out or breaks easily, this is a great pick because of the inclusion of aloe vera—which can soothe and hydrate. Even pimple patches can sometimes tear the sensitive skin around a blemish, but you won't have to worry about that with these.

Budget-friendly

Long-lasting adhesive

Includes two sizes

What We Don't Like

Thinner patch than other options

While most pimple patches aren't very pricey, The Klog's Soft Shield is one of the budget-friendliest of the bunch. Containing vegan hydrocolloid,2 the protective yet breathable barrier draws out impurities and helps your zits heal as quickly as possible. We love that these super-thin patches are almost invisible—perfect for wear during the day. They're unnoticeable whether you're in a virtual meeting or on a walk, and they'll keep your skin shielded from bacteria (and your fingers).

Who It's For

These pimple patches can be super helpful for those who find it hard to stop themselves from picking since they are so lightweight they can be worn anytime. They're also great for people on a budget or for those looking for a vegan formula patch.

A few drugstore brands have hopped on the pimple-patch bandwagon, but the best iteration comes from acne-fighting all-star Clearasil. Stick on the Spot Patches before bed, get your beauty sleep, and wake up to noticeable improvements in the size and redness of your blemishes. These patches have thinner, smooth edges, so they're able to adhere to the skin better without budging.

Who It's For

If you're a wild sleeper and often wake up to your pimple patch on your pillow, we recommend these.

What We Like

Contains skin-clearing and moisturizing ingredients

Includes two sizes

What We Don't Like

Doesn't contain hydrocolloid

Peter Thomas Roth's take on the acne patch is the super-moisturizing Invisible Dots. In addition to acne-clearing mainstays salicylic acid5 and tea tree oil,6 they call on hyaluronic acid7 to deliver much-needed moisture to the bumps that lie beneath. These aren't hydrocolloid patches, so they won't absorb the gunk out of a pimple that's already come to a head.

Who It's For

We recommend these patches for big, red pimples that you want to reduce in size quickly. They can work overnight to greatly shrink blemishes.

What We Don't Like

More effective on pimples that have come to a head

Dr. Wolinsky is a fan of COSRX Master Patches, and we're here for it. Serving up a heaping dose of hydrocolloid8 underneath each hygienic sticker, you can target even the most stubborn bumps with little effort. We also like that these Korean patches come in three different sizes.

When we tested them for ourselves, we loved that they didn't budge while we slept (even when applied over our nighttime serums). The pimple was noticeably smaller in the morning, and the patches kept the blemish from becoming irritated during use.

Who It's For

These patches come in three different sizes to best fit whatever type of pimple you have. This is a great choice if you deal with frequent acne of all kinds and need a patch that can fit both smaller and larger blemishes.

There's not much you can do about a deep pimple brewing underneath your skin—outside of placing a ZitSticka on it.

Who It's For

We recommend these patches for those with cystic acne that refuses to come to a head, as the mini microneedles can target the deep pimples that sit under the skin.

Comes with a small amount of patches

When you're dealing with hormonal acne, standard pimple patches often aren't able to reach the nodules under the skin, which can be painful and difficult to get rid of. These patches are the ones that you'll want to try to get those hard-to-reach blemishes. It has a two-step process: swipe the pad (which is infused with tea tree oil and salicylic acid) on clean skin and then apply the patch directly to the blemish. It's made with super-fine microneedles so that the ingredients are able to penetrate the skin better, and the patch is also formulated with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and peptides to hydrate and heal the affected area and effectively flatten the pimple.


Who It's For

If you've tried everything for hormonal acne and are looking for a targeted, effective treatment without taking a trip to the dermatologist, these are a great pick. Because of the powerful formula, you should be able to see results overnight.

Pimple patches are usually clear, but you can still often see the thick material—especially on darker skin tones or under makeup. If you have a blemish that you feel the need to conceal during the day, we recommend reaching for these patches from Rael. They have super thin edges that stick onto the skin seamlessly and lay as flat as possible for a hydrocolloid patch. Even though they're less noticeable than others on the market, they're still just as effective at protecting from bacteria and removing impurities from the spot overnight.


Who It's For

Picking at your skin is a hard habit to break, but it's necessary in order to not make blemishes worse and create a scar. Wearing a pimple patch throughout the day can help, and these patches from Rael will go unnoticed while you're out with friends or even at work.

Active Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 96 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes

Where We Stand

The best pimple patches overall are Peace Out Acne Healing Dots. They contain hydrocolloid, and also a blend of soothing and clearing ingredients like retinol, salicylic acid, and aloe. For a more affordable option, consider The Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch, a breathable yet protective solution that draws out impurities and speeds up healing.

What to Look for When Buying Acne Patches
Hydrocolloid: "The most important thing is that the stickers or patches are made of hydrocolloid," Dr. Wolinsky tells Byrdie, which is "something dermatologists have used for wound care for a long time." The healing ingredient seals the skin underneath the patch while absorbing fluid, flattening bumps, and minimizing inflammation.8Some options, like Peach Slices Acne Spot Dots, are made with nothing more than hydrocolloid, which does an excellent job taking care of pimples on its own.
Active Ingredients: Most acne patches utilize hydrocolloid, which can be very effective on its own. However, you'll also find options containing a range of other acne-fighting ingredients. As Dr. Wolinsky notes, "Some of these patches have salicylic acid, which may help further treat a nasty breakout." Additionally, you might see soothing aloe vera extract,14 resurfacing retinol,4 complexion-clearing tea tree oil,15 or hydrating hyaluronic acid12 on the ingredients list.
Dime Beauty Power Patches are an excellent choice if you're looking for something containing salicylic acid, and Peter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots are a great option with tea tree oil. Some patches, like Mario Badescu Drying Patches, contain both.
Size: Since pimples and breakouts come in all shapes and sizes, it's nice to have a couple of different acne patches to work with. While many brands offer only one size, some packs include two or even three sizes to cover large and small zits accordingly. For instance, The Klog's Soft Shield Pimple Patches come with two sizes. You'll also find extra-large patches, which are meant to cover multi-bump breakouts.
FAQ
How do acne patches work?

"Most acne patches work by providing a moist occluded environment so that the acne lesion can heal underneath," says Dr. Maguiness. They typically contain hydrocolloid,8 which, as Dr. Wolinsky explains, absorbs the inflammatory fluid, flattens the bump, and speeds up healing. "The added bonus is that they keep fingers off and prevent picking," notes Dr. Maguiness.


How do you apply acne patches?

Starting with freshly washed hands and clean, dry skin, carefully peel the patch off the sheet. Then, gently stick it on the pimple in question, aligning the center of the patch with the center of the pimple. Leave it on for 12 to 24 hours or until it turns opaque.


How often should you use acne patches?

Generally speaking, you can use acne patches as often as needed. Since they target only a very small portion of your skin, you shouldn't have to worry about irritating the rest of your face or neck. In some cases, you might need to use two or three consecutive patches to get rid of a particularly stubborn pimple.

ACNE BRANDS CAPITALIZING ON THE “ICK FACTOR” AS A RECIPE FOR TIKTOK SUCCESS
CRISTINA MONTEMAYOR
PUBLISHED APRIL 24, 2022
FEATURE SKINCARE MARKETING
Rabizo via Canva

Since the dawn of the internet, “oddly satisfying” videos have captivated people’s attention. Pimple-popping videos are among the oldest and most popular types of strangely satisfying content that people love to watch (or love to hate-watch). 

Internet historians trace the origin of the trend back to 2015 with Dr. Pimple Popper’s viral videos, but even after seven years and a network television show, people still aren’t sick of these ick-inducing videos. TikTok dermatologists are capitalizing on the trend, posting their reaction to some close-up videos of pimple popping, blackhead squeezing, and cyst squashing, racking up millions of views in their expert dissection of another’s expert dissection. 

While watching these videos through half-shut eyes is somewhat satisfying, it’s even more satisfying to experience the ick IRL. Pimple patches allow people to take their overfilled zits into their own hands and experience the visual and physical relief of popping a pimple sans scalpel. Pimple patches have soared in popularity over the last few years, with searches expected to grow 30% over the next 12 months according to Spate.

Acne brands selling pimple patches are tapping into the pimple-popping trend to showcase the effectiveness of their products, and seeing incredible engagement and conversion on these engrossing videos. BeautyMatter spoke to four acne brands to understand how they make the most of this long-standing trend and why they believe it resonates so deeply with their customers and on social. 

Peace Out Skincare has been on a mission to erase the stigma surrounding acne since the brand launched in 2017—long before acne positivity entered the beauty zeitgeist. The brand’s best-selling acne patches were the first on the market to combine active ingredients with a medical grade hydrocolloid polymer, leading to more than 35 million patches sold worldwide. Peace Out’s honest and relatable approach to acne has made the brand wildly popular on TikTok, garnering 90.1K followers and 2.6MM likes. 

The ​​#peaceoutskincare tag has over 26.1MM views, with nearly all of the most popular videos falling into the “oddly satisfying” content category, showing the overfilled pore strips and pimple patches. Junior Pence, Chief Marketing Officer and Creative Director at Peace Out, says that these videos were primarily user-generated in the beginning.

“We got early into understanding the ‘gross’ effect of Peace Out Acne Dots,” says Pence. “It started out as all organic UGC. Our consumers, people that know our brand and love our brand, put it up there themselves.”

Peace Out seeds product to nano and micro influencers, many of whom have posted about the brand before. The brand strives to build and nurture these relationships, believing them to be more fruitful than paid promotions with large influencers. 

“We've always believed that the micro influencer is the number one influencer that you could possibly ever have. It’s all about honesty and integrity,” says Pence. “What we learn from our consumers and our customers when they give us feedback is that they will only trust a nano influencer.”

“We got early into understanding the ‘gross’ effect of Peace Out Acne Dots.”
BY JUNIOR PENCE, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER + CREATIVE DIRECTOR, PEACE OUT

Pence says that the brand only receives positive feedback on the “gross” videos they share of customers using their products. In fact, the videos have been so successful that the brands use them in paid social ads, where they continuously have a click-through rate of around 7%, as opposed to average 3.4%.  

“We've never got pushback on showing the product or being honest about what happens when you use the product because that's the benefit of the product, watching the gunk being sucked into the hydrocolloid.”

One of their more recent viral videos is a 20-second close-up video showing someone removing an acne patch, revealing the juicy inside. The video has racked up over 3.2 million views and over 289,000 likes. Pence says this speaks to the consumer demand for authenticity in marketing, especially in skincare. 

“I think they're looking for [brands] to be authentic, and to know that you're actually telling the truth about what your product is and what it does. What is the benefit of using this product?” says Pence. “At the end of the day, that's the biggest feedback we get. People love our product because it does what it says it does in the least amount of time so that they can go back to feeling good about themselves.”

Peace Out isn’t the only acne brand capitalizing on the popularity of these #oddlysatisfying videos. ZitSticka, a skincare brand known for its acne patches, sees higher engagement on these videos versus others.

“There’s a kind of visceral satisfaction in seeing, say, the contents of your zit extracted or a hyper-macro video of a hair being tweezed,” says Melissa Kenny, Director of Communications at ZitSticka. “It feels almost primal, but also difficult to trace! This category of content definitely arouses a good deal of interest/interaction for ZitSticka on TikTok (as well as Instagram) which might be explained as being cathartic or stress-relieving for some.”

For COSRX, the Korean skincare brand credited for being the first to market with the iconic Acne Pimple Master Patch, sees a deeper explanation for the popularity of these videos.

“Social media is a diary of our collective unconscious,” a representative from the skincare brand tells BeautyMatter. “The oddly satisfying videos reflect our wider sentiments, preferences, and desires. People can't stop watching these satisfying videos because they are projecting themselves onto the person in the video who’s pulling off an acne pimple patch from their skin.”

Bioré Skincare is best known for its classic pore strip, which predates the acne patch craze of recent years by at least decade. The Biore tag on TikTok is filled with examples of this trend, garnering over 88 million views. The brand knows exactly why consumers keep coming back to the iconic pore strip: the satisfaction of clean and clear pores.

“There’s something about people sharing their stripping experience—and the gunk that comes with it—that consumers just can’t get enough of,” says Leah Stone, Associate Director of Face Care at Bioré Skincare. “Watching up-close and personal content of others clearing out their pores can evoke feelings of fulfillment and productivity, and can even inspire the viewer to take action when it comes to their own skin. There is also a sense of community when it comes to these videos—they bring a certain comfort to some viewers in knowing they’re not alone in their skin struggles, and all who watch them share that same intrigue and craving for a satisfying experience.”

Sonia Elyss, beauty marketing strategist and President and founder of Round Twelve, a digital marketing consultancy, explains why she believes these types of videos overperform on TikTok. 

“While I do believe there is an audience that truly enjoys and feels that odd sense of satisfaction from this up-close-and-personal look at something that is deemed ‘gross,’ many others just have to slow down to watch, even though they truly feel it IS gross,” says Elyss. “Consider the car crash effect. Most people don't actually want to see anything gruesome, but everyone slows down to watch! As we watch and rewatch TikTok's algorithm picks up on our ‘interest’ in the content distributing it to others on the platform at a faster rate.”

Most people will never experience an extraction worthy of Dr. Pimple Popper, and that’s probably a good thing. But most people will experience the occasional pimple, and when they do, there may be a small part of them that feels giddy at the excuse to see a pimple patch at its fullest potential. Even if you don’t find watching these videos on TikTok #oddlysatisfying, when it happens to you, it’s just plain satisfying.

The best blemish patches out there
Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2023
I have tried all types of blemish patches, everything from thin and sheer to rainbow clouds and stars designs, but I will never stray from these. These COSRX blemish patches give you a good assortment of sizes, and they are virtually invisible once put on, even having a blurring effect making the blemish less noticeable.

The healing process after applying these are wonderful too because they do not dry your skin and the blemish is usually gone within a day or two. I have dry skin, so I stopped using spot treatments and switched to solely these because I was not a fan of the flakiness of my skin from the spot treatments. I also love knowing that my blemish is covered and protected, from everything, and even stops me from messing with it and making it worse. Not only that, but I also have skin that can be sensitive to some adhesives, but never had any issues or reactions with these. They adhere really well, and will not budge until you decided to remove them, unlike others, where I may go to bed with the patch on my face but wake up with it stuck to the pillow.

This is really an excellent product it does exactly what it says --either dramatically improves or gets rid of the blemish altogether anywhere from as quickly as overnight to two to three days at most depending on the blemish you do have to apply it on clean dry skin so it sticks well I wouldn't wear it out during the day because while it is pretty sheer you can still see it because it doesn't lay flush on your skin but it does exactly what it says and it's fantastic and I can't say enough about it

I get picky with pimples and these are a godsend—basically the only way I’ll stop is a physical barrier. These don’t suck pimple gunk out, but they definitely encourage them to come to a head if they have one. I was resistant to paying for tiny hydrocolloid patches, but these are just worth it for me. I’ve tried other pimple patches (US brands) and they frankly don’t compare.

Amazing how well these work to draw out gunk even if you've already popped your zit and thought you got everything out. Plus it works great to speed up healing afterward.

I would wear these patches overnight on zits, and this seemed to help reduce their size most of the time.

Works the way it supposed to, but the first pack I opened already had a little white dots on the pimple patches. It may have been stored somewhere with moisture, but they still looked new, so I will still be using them. I love that they have a variety of sizes in this pack came with a lot. I typically use a different brand, but they were not available online. Good overall.

I have had two blemishes on my forehead that never came to a "head" but wouldn't go away either.
After just a week of using this product, they are almost gone! A generous amount came with the order; but I will make sure I NEVER run out!

Half half
Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023
Sometimes the patch is thicker than my *** but sometimes it’s as thin as my ***. The thick one that I got for the past 2 orders wouldn’t stick to my skin and by the time I woke up in the morning, the patch will be on my hair, my bed sheet, my back and nowhere to be found. It’s good for sure but it’s like playing a Russian roulette where the thick patch is the bullet.

Such a great value for so much less. I was obsessed with obsessed with the mighty patches put they get really expensive for not a lot especially when you have a lot of pimples. Personally I get really deep painful pimples that last forever these take them away just leashing the little red mark like the patches do. So impressed with this product and the value. Love it so much and could not recommend this more.

We put The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch to the test after receiving a complimentary sample from the brand. Keep reading for our full product review. 

Editor’s Note: We reviewed this article on September 24, 2023. As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.

Period, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren't blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month. 

Lucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I'll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.

Keep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.

COSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH

BEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types

KEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid

PRICE: $19

ABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.

About My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts

My skin can be unpredictable. But, as I've gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.  

Ingredients: One key, familiar ingredient 

The tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.

The Feel: Like a bandage

You can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Packaging: Easy to store

The 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish

I placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.

Even with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn't budge overnight.

If you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn't expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn't gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don't believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Value: Worth it

Was this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

Similar Products: You've got options 

squish. Flower Power Acne Patches ($14): This pack of 20 floral hydrocolloid pimple patches to help zap blemishes overnight and let's face it, they're pretty darn cute. Pimple, but make them pretty. 

Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Variety Pack ($7): These 36 count medical-grade, chemical-free, allergy-tested patches stay put no matter how much you toss and turn throughout the night. 

Final Verdict

If you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won't regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.

Live by Acne Patches? Dermatologists Share the Best 15 Brands of 2023

With faves from Hero Cosmetics, Peace Out, Clearasil, and more.

BYRDIE / JACLYN MASTROPASQUA

There's no shortage of over-the-counter products for clearing breakouts. But when you only have one or two zits at any given time, there's no need to treat your entire face. Enter the pimple patch, a targeted way to zap acne without exposing the rest of your skin to undue drying or irritation. According to board-certified dermatologist Sheilagh Maguiness, MD, acne patches typically contain hydrocolloid gel,1 which is often used in wound care. Hydrocolloid patches are able to keep the spot moist in order to accelerate healing and protect. In addition to healing blemishes, Dr. Maguiness notes, "The hydrocolloid in the acne sticker can help absorb sebum and dirt." 

Claire Wolinsky, MD, a New York dermatologist specializing in facial rejuvenation, says she loves pimple patches and recommends them frequently: "One reason they are particularly helpful in treating acne is because once covered, patients can't pick or squeeze their pimple, which reduces the risk of infection and bacteria." And with less trauma to the skin, Dr. Wolinsky says you're less likely to experience scarring or discoloration.

We conducted hours of research on the best acne patches, evaluating each on active ingredients to target acne as well as ingredients to soothe skin and prevent redness. We also looked at things like how easy they are to apply and how well they stay on. After considering dozens of brands and consulting with two celebrity dermatologists, we landed on the following best in show.

What We Don't Like

Only one size

Celebrity aesthetician Joshua Ross of SkinLab stands behind Peace Out Acne Healing Dots. "They employ hydrocolloid2 technology that helps extract impurities and guards against external elements," he explains. What's more, the patches create a barrier between pimples and your bacteria-laden fingers while delivering a time-released infusion of ingredients.

Cosmetic nurse Kristina Kitsos is also a fan of Peace Out. "They contain salicylic acid,3 which penetrates pores to target acne blemishes and blackheads," she tells Byrdie. Additionally, Kitsos appreciates that these acne patches contain soothing aloe vera to minimize redness and skin-clearing standby vitamin A (aka retinol).4 She says that since they're formulated with hydrating ingredients, the skin is able to heal quicker and better than if a drying, alcohol formula was used.

Who It's For

If you have skin that dries out or breaks easily, this is a great pick because of the inclusion of aloe vera—which can soothe and hydrate. Even pimple patches can sometimes tear the sensitive skin around a blemish, but you won't have to worry about that with these.

While most pimple patches aren't very pricey, The Klog's Soft Shield is one of the budget-friendliest of the bunch.

They're unnoticeable whether you're in a virtual meeting or on a walk, and they'll keep your skin shielded from bacteria (and your fingers).

Who It's For

Peter Thomas Roth's take on the acne patch is the super-moisturizing Invisible Dots. In addition to acne-clearing mainstays salicylic acid5 and tea tree oil,6 they call on hyaluronic acid7 to deliver much-needed moisture to the bumps that lie beneath. These aren't hydrocolloid patches, so they won't absorb the gunk out of a pimple that's already come to a head.

We recommend these patches for big, red pimples that you want to reduce in size quickly. They can work overnight to greatly shrink blemishes.

Pimple patches are usually clear, but you can still often see the thick material—especially on darker skin tones or under makeup.

Even though they're less noticeable than others on the market, they're still just as effective at protecting from bacteria and removing impurities from the spot overnight.


Who It's For

Picking at your skin is a hard habit to break, but it's necessary in order to not make blemishes worse and create a scar. Wearing a pimple patch throughout the day can help, and these patches from Rael will go unnoticed while you're out with friends or even at work.

Active Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 96 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes

Where We Stand

The best pimple patches overall are Peace Out Acne Healing Dots. They contain hydrocolloid, and also a blend of soothing and clearing ingredients like retinol, salicylic acid, and aloe. For a more affordable option, consider The Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch, a breathable yet protective solution that draws out impurities and speeds up healing.

What to Look for When Buying Acne Patches
Hydrocolloid: "The most important thing is that the stickers or patches are made of hydrocolloid," Dr. Wolinsky tells Byrdie, which is "something dermatologists have used for wound care for a long time." The healing ingredient seals the skin underneath the patch while absorbing fluid, flattening bumps, and minimizing inflammation.8Some options, like Peach Slices Acne Spot Dots, are made with nothing more than hydrocolloid, which does an excellent job taking care of pimples on its own.
Active Ingredients: Most acne patches utilize hydrocolloid, which can be very effective on its own. However, you'll also find options containing a range of other acne-fighting ingredients. As Dr. Wolinsky notes, "Some of these patches have salicylic acid, which may help further treat a nasty breakout." Additionally, you might see soothing aloe vera extract,14 resurfacing retinol,4 complexion-clearing tea tree oil,15 or hydrating hyaluronic acid12 on the ingredients list.
Dime Beauty Power Patches are an excellent choice if you're looking for something containing salicylic acid, and Peter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots are a great option with tea tree oil. Some patches, like Mario Badescu Drying Patches, contain both.
Size: Since pimples and breakouts come in all shapes and sizes, it's nice to have a couple of different acne patches to work with. While many brands offer only one size, some packs include two or even three sizes to cover large and small zits accordingly. For instance, The Klog's Soft Shield Pimple Patches come with two sizes. You'll also find extra-large patches, which are meant to cover multi-bump breakouts.
FAQ
How do acne patches work?

"Most acne patches work by providing a moist occluded environment so that the acne lesion can heal underneath," says Dr. Maguiness. They typically contain hydrocolloid,8 which, as Dr. Wolinsky explains, absorbs the inflammatory fluid, flattens the bump, and speeds up healing. "The added bonus is that they keep fingers off and prevent picking," notes Dr. Maguiness.


How do you apply acne patches?

Starting with freshly washed hands and clean, dry skin, carefully peel the patch off the sheet. Then, gently stick it on the pimple in question, aligning the center of the patch with the center of the pimple. Leave it on for 12 to 24 hours or until it turns opaque.


How often should you use acne patches?

Generally speaking, you can use acne patches as often as needed. Since they target only a very small portion of your skin, you shouldn't have to worry about irritating the rest of your face or neck. In some cases, you might need to use two or three consecutive patches to get rid of a particularly stubborn pimple.

Do Pimple Patches Work?
By Rachel Murphy Published on May 30, 2023
 Fact checked by Nick Blackmer
Print 

Photo Illustration by Amelia Manley for Verywell Health; Getty Images

Key Takeaways
A pimple patch is a type of wound dressing called a hydrocolloid patch that is effective for protecting pimples and speeding the healing process.
Some pimple patches may contain additional ingredients to promote healing.
If you have sensitive skin, be cautious and start with hydrocolloid only.

Acne is a common problem that has spawned an entire industry of products claiming to treat it. One of the most recent tools to gain popularity is the acne or pimple patch, a thin circular or triangular patch made from hydrocolloid that claims to help clear acne faster than it could clear up on its own.

But do they work? The answer is a murky yes. Pimple patches do help speed the healing process, but not necessarily for the reasons you might assume.

How Do Pimple Patches Work?

At their most basic, pimple patches are wound care, Geeta Yadav, MD, dermatologist and founder of FACET Dermatology in Toronto, Canada, told Verywell. There are two basic categories of patches: traditional patches that work by covering and protecting the lesion with a hydrocolloid membrane, and those that have additional ingredients or technology such as microneedles or topical treatments like salicylic acid.

“Hydrocolloid is really used in wound care. It can seal over broken skin or something wet and draw the fluid out of the lesion,” Yadav said. “In a pimple setting, it draws out the sebum or pus out of the pimples and promote faster healing.”

Patches with added ingredients can help by additionally speeding the exfoliation process, which clears away dead skin and sebum, revealing healthier skin underneath. While the added ingredients are useful, Yadav said that the most important functionality is protecting the wound from your own prying fingers.

“Everyone picks,” she said. “One of the best features of having a patch, whether it has active ingredients or not, is that every time you go to touch that pimple, it’s protected from your own hands and the bacteria that you might have under your nails or anything that might make it flare.”

 How to Heal a Big Pimple That Won't Go Away
How Effective Are Pimple Patches?

A single-center, randomized clinical trial completed by Johnson & Johnson in 2021 indicated that using a pimple patch for one week on either popped or unpopped pimples did improve the look of pimples. The study also revealed that popped pimples healed faster using hydrocolloid patches than those that healed without. 

While hydrocolloid patches alone aren’t adding any drying agents to the skin, they are creating an atmosphere of healing. If patients have had success with other topical solutions, they can also apply those before using a hydrocolloid patch, said Asmi Sanghvi, MD, dermatologist and clinical instructor at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City

“If you plan to apply a topical treatment underneath an acne patch, the occlusive nature of the patch will help that treatment penetrate deeper and more intensely,” Sanghvi told Verywell. “This is fine as long as the topical treatment isn’t irritating to the skin—so topical clindamycin or topical azelaic acid are fine. However, if the topical treatment is a retinoid, salicylic acid, or benzoyl peroxide, it could potentially lead to inflammation and irritation of the normal skin.”

 What to Know About Topical Retinoids for Acne
When to Use a Pimple Patch

Yadav said that the best time to start using a pimple patch is when you first start to see a pimple form, especially if the patch contains active ingredients.

Even if the pimple is fully formed, though, there are still benefits to using a patch. The less that you touch the affected area, the faster it will heal. Even if you’ve already popped the pimple, covering it with a protective patch is a good idea.

How to Choose the Right Pimple Patch


The field of options for pimple patches has grown considerably over the last few years, and now there are many to choose from. Here are a few key criteria to consider. 

Price: Most pimple patches come in packs, and packs start as little as $6 for 24 patches of various sizes to $30.
Active ingredients: Hydrocolloid alone is helpful in healing. But some patches include salicylic acid, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and a host of other ingredients. If you have sensitive skin, it may be best to start with hydrocolloid only.
Size and shape: Some patches come with a variety of sized patches or different shapes to fit on different areas of the face.
Skin tone: Most patches offer translucent options, but you’ll want to make sure they blend with your skin tone if you plan to wear them during the day. Or go bold and choose a patch with a pattern on the surface. Sanghvi said that she prefers the Mighty Patch Invisible since it blends with nearly any skin tone.
Potential Side Effects 

Since hydrocolloid patches only create a protective environment, there are few side effects, but patches with added ingredients can cause sensitivity depending on your skin type. Sanghvi said that patches with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid may leave red marks on the skin where the patch was on those with sensitive skin.

What This Means For You

Pimple patches are the bandages of skincare. When used as such, they are an effective way to keep your pimple clean and free from bacteria. For those with sensitive skin, start with a patch that doesn’t include additional ingredients and see if they work for you. They won’t cure acne overnight, but they may prevent scarring by preventing you from picking and damaging your skin.

What makes us unique?

Our 360º holistic cycle care integrates daily self-care rituals with period care to support you through your whole cycle, not just the days you’re bleeding.

Why do we love what we do?

Hearing from our happy customers about how our products have made periods more comfortable, acne more manageable, PMS cramps less painful, and more!

 
Glow With Your Flow

From menstrual cramps to hormonal acne and everything in between, Rael has you covered so you can feel your best all cycle.

 works without drying
Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2023
Verified Purchase
I get redness, drying, and irritation from most pimple spot treatments. Salicylic acid was my go to before, but this works better. It will usually zap baby pimples overnight and for bigger ones, it calms and prevents them from worsening and they go away in 2-4 days. It's clear, easy to apply, no odor. I've even used the tiniest amount on rosacea pimples, followed by cica gel, without irritation. For reference, I get hormonal adult pimples and have mild rosacea. I'm really happy with this product.

 Poor Design
Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2023
Verified Purchase
I think the formula is good at working as advertised, but I was only able to use it a handful of times. The packaging design is very flawed - the pen works by clicking the end, but there is no lock function so you can click the end in so many ways. Picking it up and putting it down but most of all, just having it in a bag while traveling. I will not buy again since I only got seven applications before it ran out, with so much of the product stuck in the cap of the pen from being pushed out while not in use.

There are 36 variable size patches so you can cover different size spots. They are sealed in a sterile pouch. The patches are transparent but with slight tan color so it blends well with my skin. Seems like it is working great, happy to have gotten it so fast!

Pimple Patches: Do They Work, and Are They Right for You?
Written by Maggie Aime, MSN, RN | Reviewed by Maria Robinson, MD, MBA
Published on March 1, 2023

Key takeaways:

Pimple patches absorb excess oil and impurities from pimples while creating a protective barrier to keep bacteria out. 

Although pimple patches are a convenient and easy way to treat pimples, their effectiveness varies. And some patches can cause skin irritation. 

Talk to your dermatologist about the best treatment appropriate for your skin and acne type.

Anastasiia Zabolotna/iStock via Getty Images Plus

Few things are more frustrating than a glaring pimple on your face. Whether you’re dealing with one zit or an acne breakout, you’ve likely researched ways to get rid of pimples.

Enter pimple patches — also called acne patches or zit stickers. These popular patches are small, thin stickers that promise flatter acne and clearer skin. While they may be helpful, pimple patches don’t work on all types of acne.

How effective are pimple patches?

When used correctly, pimple patches can be an effective and convenient solution to treat certain types of pimples.

A small study found that hydrocolloid patches effectively reduced redness, oily secretion, and dark spots in people with mild or moderate acne. Another study suggests people with facial acne had less acne and dark pigmentation after using dissolving microneedle patches for 28 days. But, these were small trials, and more research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of pimple patches.

Still, most of the benefits of pimple patches may be from their protective barrier property. If you’re dealing with acne, you were likely told that pimple popping is a no-no. 

That’s because squeezing or popping your acne can cause it to take longer to clear and result in dark spots and scarring. With a pimple patch on and by keeping your hands off your zits, you’re allowing your skin the chance to heal naturally, all while lowering your risk of infection.

But, some people may not see any results after using pimple patches. Pimple patches only work on the surface level of your skin and are not appropriate for all types of pimples. And since there are many types of patches — like non-medicated, medicated, and microneedle patches — you need the right patch for your acne.

For example, patches that contain hydrocolloid only may work for acne that has a “head” or has popped. But those with added anti-acne ingredients may be more appropriate for those red and inflamed pimples. And if you’re struggling with acne cysts, which are deeper in the skin, pimple patches may not be effective.

In any case, it’s best to see a dermatologist to figure out the best treatment for your acne, pimples, and skin breakouts.

How do pimple patches work?

Pimple patches work by absorbing excess oil and pus from pimples. They essentially shrink the zits and lessen inflammation. They’re commonly made of hydrocolloid, a gel-forming material originally used for wound healing. Hydrocolloid may draw out impurities from pimples while providing a moist environment that can help acne spots heal faster.

A pimple patch can also lower the risk of your pimple getting infected — or re-infected — because it creates a protective barrier. When you have a pimple patch on, you’re less likely to pick at the area and introduce bacteria.

Along with hydrocolloid, some pimple patches are medicated with acne-fighting ingredients, like:

Salicylic acid

Benzoyl peroxide

Glycolic acid

Niacinamide

Some types of patches have dissolving microneedles that slightly puncture the skin’s surface to allow the added ingredients to penetrate the skin.

You can buy pimple patches without a prescription online or over the counter (OTC) in a store.

These patches come in various shapes and sizes and can be applied during the day or at night, followed by the rest of your skincare routine.

Most pimple patches are transparent, which means they’re invisible and can be worn under makeup. But, if you’re looking for something more fun — like a bright yellow star-shaped zit sticker — that’s also available.

What are the side effects of pimple patches?

While pimple patches are generally safe, they may cause side effects such as:

Skin irritation: You may see redness or dryness around the area where the patch is applied. This is especially true for patches with added ingredients to treat acne.

Allergic reaction: It’s possible to develop an allergic reaction to the materials used in the patch. For example, the adhesive or any of the acne-fighting medications in the patch may aggravate your skin or cause hyperpigmentation.

Although extremely rare, some people have had serious allergic reactions to acne products. Get medical care right away if you develop symptoms like:

Trouble breathing

Face, eye, lip, or tongue swelling

Hives

Tightness in your throat

Want to try pimple patches? Your dermatologist can help you pick the best pimple patch based on your skin type and acne.

If seeing a dermatologist is not an option, do a patch test first. Start by applying one pimple patch for a few hours to see how your skin reacts before moving on to a larger area. If you experience any reactions, stop using the patch and let your healthcare provider know right away.

How do you use pimple patches?

Pimple patches are quite easy to use. Follow these steps for the best results:

Cleanse and completely dry your skin.

Make sure your hands are also clean to avoid contaminating the patch and your skin.

Select the appropriate patch size.

Peel off the patch taking care not to touch its center.

Apply the patch directly over the spot.

Leave the patch on based on the instructions on the package.

Peel off the patch and discard.

Wash the area and apply a new patch if needed.

How long do you have to use pimple patches to get results?

Most pimple patches can be used and changed as needed until the pimple has fully healed — which may take a few days. The duration depends on many factors, such as:

The type of patch you’re using

The type of acne being treated

Your skin type

The manufacturer’s recommendations

How long you need to wear a patch will vary by brand. Microneedle and medicated pimple batches need to be worn for at least several hours. Non-medicated hydrocolloid patches may be worn for 2 to 3 days, as long as you change the patch every day.

Remember to cleanse and dry the area before applying a new patch. For the best results, follow the directions specific to the patch you’re using.

Who should not use pimple patches?

It’s better to avoid using pimple patches if you have sensitive skin. This is also true if you’re allergic to adhesive or any acne product that may have been added to the patch. In this case, don’t use pimple patches, and discuss your treatment options with your dermatologist.

If you’re breaking out a lot or have more serious acne, pimple patches may not be your best option. You may need stronger OTC or prescription medications.

Alternatives to pimple patches

If using a pimple patch is not an option for you, consider these alternatives and tips to manage your acne:

Topical acne treatments: These include OTC benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid that can be applied directly to the acne or your entire face. They help get rid of dead skin cells and kill bacteria. You can also try using an OTC retinoid, like adapalene (Differin), to help unclog pores. Just keep in mind adapalene is not a spot treatment. It needs to be used for at least 4 to 6 weeks for best results.

Oral medications: Antibiotics or isotretinoin (Absorica) can be prescribed by a dermatologist to help clear up cystic acne. Birth control pills and spironolactone (Aldactone) are treatment options that also need a prescription.

Good skin care: Use a gentle cleanser to wash your skin. Choose skin care products that are free of oil and alcohol and won’t clog pores (non-comedogenic).

Hands off: Resist the urge to pop or squeeze your acne and avoid touching your face throughout the day.

Being patient: It may take a few weeks to see results, so give your treatment time to work.

The bottom line

While they’re not a long-term solution, pimple patches may help lessen the appearance and duration of your pimples. But they don’t work on all types of acne.

When choosing a pimple patch, be sure to read the ingredients and follow the instructions carefully. If you’re unsure which pimple patch is appropriate for you or if you have sensitive skin, talk to your dermatologist before using these patches.

Pimple-popping videos are among the oldest and most popular types of strangely satisfying content that people love to watch (or love to hate-watch).\xa0\n\nInternet historians trace the origin of the trend back to 2015 with Dr. Pimple Popper’s viral videos, but even after seven years and a network television show, people still aren’t sick of these ick-inducing videos. TikTok dermatologists are capitalizing on the trend, posting their reaction to some close-up videos of pimple popping, blackhead squeezing, and cyst squashing, racking up millions of views in their expert dissection of another’s expert dissection.\xa0\n\nWhile watching these videos through half-shut eyes is somewhat satisfying, it’s even more satisfying to experience the ick IRL. Pimple patches allow people to take their overfilled zits into their own hands and experience the visual and physical relief of popping a pimple sans scalpel. Pimple patches have soared in popularity over the last few years, with searches expected to grow 30% over the next 12 months according to Spate.\n\nAcne brands selling pimple patches are tapping into the pimple-popping trend to showcase the effectiveness of their products, and seeing incredible engagement and conversion on these engrossing videos. BeautyMatter spoke to four acne brands to understand how they make the most of this long-standing trend and why they believe it resonates so deeply with their customers and on social.\xa0\n\nPeace Out Skincare has been on a mission to erase the stigma surrounding acne since the brand launched in 2017—long before acne positivity entered the beauty zeitgeist. The brand’s best-selling acne patches were the first on the market to combine active ingredients with a medical grade hydrocolloid polymer, leading to more than 35 million patches sold worldwide. Peace Out’s honest and relatable approach to acne has made the brand wildly popular on TikTok, garnering 90.1K followers and 2.6MM likes.\xa0\n\nThe \u200b\u200b#peaceoutskincare tag has over 26.1MM views, with nearly all of the most popular videos falling into the “oddly satisfying” content category, showing the overfilled pore strips and pimple patches. Junior Pence, Chief Marketing Officer and Creative Director at Peace Out, says that these videos were primarily user-generated in the beginning.\n\n“We got early into understanding the ‘gross’ effect of Peace Out Acne Dots,” says Pence. “It started out as all organic UGC. Our consumers, people that know our brand and love our brand, put it up there themselves.”\n\nPeace Out seeds product to nano and micro influencers, many of whom have posted about the brand before. The brand strives to build and nurture these relationships, believing them to be more fruitful than paid promotions with large influencers.\xa0\n\n“We\'ve always believed that the micro influencer is the number one influencer that you could possibly ever have. It’s all about honesty and integrity,” says Pence. “What we learn from our consumers and our customers when they give us feedback is that they will only trust a nano influencer.”\n\n“We got early into understanding the ‘gross’ effect of Peace Out Acne Dots.”\nBY JUNIOR PENCE, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER + CREATIVE DIRECTOR, PEACE OUT\n\nPence says that the brand only receives positive feedback on the “gross” videos they share of customers using their products. In fact, the videos have been so successful that the brands use them in paid social ads, where they continuously have a click-through rate of around 7%, as opposed to average 3.4%. \xa0\n\n“We\'ve never got pushback on showing the product or being honest about what happens when you use the product because that\'s the benefit of the product, watching the gunk being sucked into the hydrocolloid.”\n\nOne of their more recent viral videos is a 20-second close-up video showing someone removing an acne patch, revealing the juicy inside. The video has racked up over 3.2 million views and over 289,000 likes. Pence says this speaks to the consumer demand for authenticity in marketing, especially in skincare.\xa0\n\n“I think they\'re looking for [brands] to be authentic, and to know that you\'re actually telling the truth about what your product is and what it does. What is the benefit of using this product?” says Pence. “At the end of the day, that\'s the biggest feedback we get. People love our product because it does what it says it does in the least amount of time so that they can go back to feeling good about themselves.”\n\nPeace Out isn’t the only acne brand capitalizing on the popularity of these #oddlysatisfying videos. ZitSticka, a skincare brand known for its acne patches, sees higher engagement on these videos versus others.\n\n“There’s a kind of visceral satisfaction in seeing, say, the contents of your zit extracted or a hyper-macro video of a hair being tweezed,” says Melissa Kenny, Director of Communications at ZitSticka. “It feels almost primal, but also difficult to trace! This category of content definitely arouses a good deal of interest/interaction for ZitSticka on TikTok (as well as Instagram) which might be explained as being cathartic or stress-relieving for some.”\n\nFor COSRX, the Korean skincare brand credited for being the first to market with the iconic Acne Pimple Master Patch, sees a deeper explanation for the popularity of these videos.\n\n“Social media is a diary of our collective unconscious,” a representative from the skincare brand tells BeautyMatter. “The oddly satisfying videos reflect our wider sentiments, preferences, and desires. People can\'t stop watching these satisfying videos because they are projecting themselves onto the person in the video who’s pulling off an acne pimple patch from their skin.”\n\nBioré Skincare is best known for its classic pore strip, which predates the acne patch craze of recent years by at least decade. The Biore tag on TikTok is filled with examples of this trend, garnering over 88 million views. The brand knows exactly why consumers keep coming back to the iconic pore strip: the satisfaction of clean and clear pores.\n\n“There’s something about people sharing their stripping experience—and the gunk that comes with it—that consumers just can’t get enough of,” says Leah Stone, Associate Director of Face Care at Bioré Skincare. “Watching up-close and personal content of others clearing out their pores can evoke feelings of fulfillment and productivity, and can even inspire the viewer to take action when it comes to their own skin. There is also a sense of community when it comes to these videos—they bring a certain comfort to some viewers in knowing they’re not alone in their skin struggles, and all who watch them share that same intrigue and craving for a satisfying experience.”\n\nSonia Elyss, beauty marketing strategist and President and founder of Round Twelve, a digital marketing consultancy, explains why she believes these types of videos overperform on TikTok.\xa0\n\n“While I do believe there is an audience that truly enjoys and feels that odd sense of satisfaction from this up-close-and-personal look at something that is deemed ‘gross,’ many others just have to slow down to watch, even though they truly feel it IS gross,” says Elyss. “Consider the car crash effect. Most people don\'t actually want to see anything gruesome, but everyone slows down to watch! As we watch and rewatch TikTok\'s algorithm picks up on our ‘interest’ in the content distributing it to others on the platform at a faster rate.”\n\nMost people will never experience an extraction worthy of Dr. Pimple Popper, and that’s probably a good thing. But most people will experience the occasional pimple, and when they do, there may be a small part of them that feels giddy at the excuse to see a pimple patch at its fullest potential. Even if you don’t find watching these videos on TikTok #oddlysatisfying, when it happens to you, it’s just plain satisfying.\n\n×\n\n2\nARTICLE(S) REMAINING\n\nSUBSCRIBE TODAY FOR FULL ACCESS\nRELATED\nHERO COSMETICS: RETHINKING ACNE TREATMENTS ONE PATCH AT A TIME\nAPR. 8, 2019\nERNO LASZLO: CAPTURING THE CHINESE MARKET BEAUTY PRIZE\nJAN. 23, 2019\nBEAUTY DISRUPTOR SERIES: SASKIA WILSON-BROWN ON OPEN-ACCESS SCENT\nSEP. 1, 2022\nEXPERIMENT CO-FOUNDERS ON SCIENCE BEAUTY 2.0\nFEB. 19, 2023\nPEACE OUT SKINCARE: FUTURE50 2023\nJUN. 4, 2023\nMOTIF: REPLACING TRENDS WITH SCIENCE AND RAISING THE STANDARDS OF SKINCARE\nSEP. 21, 2023\nExclusives\nARTICLES\nPODCASTS\nREPORTS\nAbout\nABOUT US\nMEMBERSHIPS\nConnect\nADVERTISING + SPONSORSHIPS\nCONTRIBUTORS, TIPS + STORIES\nMEDIA + PRESS INQUIRES\nMore\nMY ACCOUNT\nTERMS\nPRIVACY\nJoin the Newsletter\n\n\nSUBMIT\n\n\n\n     \n\n© BEAUTYMATTER 2023\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nInterested in\n\nthe latest beauty\n\nindustry insights?\n\nYES\nNO\n'}]

We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.\n\nPeriod, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren\'t blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month.\xa0\n\nLucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I\'ll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.\n\nKeep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.\n\nCOSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH\n\nBEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types\n\nKEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid\n\nPRICE: $19\n\nABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.\n\nAbout My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts\n\nMy skin can be unpredictable. But, as I\'ve gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.\xa0\xa0\n\nIngredients: One key, familiar ingredient\xa0\n\nThe tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.\n\nThe Feel: Like a bandage\n\nYou can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Packaging: Easy to store\n\nThe 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish\n\nI placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.\n\nEven with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn\'t budge overnight.\n\nIf you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn\'t expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn\'t gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don\'t believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Value: Worth it\n\nWas this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nSimilar Products: You\'ve got options\xa0\n\nsquish. Flower Power Acne Patches ($14): This pack of 20 floral hydrocolloid pimple patches to help zap blemishes overnight and let\'s face it, they\'re pretty darn cute. Pimple, but make them pretty.\xa0\n\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Variety Pack ($7): These 36 count medical-grade, chemical-free, allergy-tested patches stay put no matter how much you toss and turn throughout the night.\xa0\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nIf you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won\'t regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.\n\n The 15 Best Acne Spot Treatments to Zap Pimples Fast\nSpecs\nPRODUCT NAME\nAcne Pimple Master Patch\nPRODUCT BRAND\nCOSRX\nPRICE\n$19.00\nWEIGHT\n0.1 oz.\nINCLUDED\n24 acne patches, in 3 different sizes\nINGREDIENTS\nCellulose gum, Styrene Isoprene Styrene Block Copolymer, Polysobutylene, Petroleum Resin, Polyurethane Film, Liquid Paraffin, Tetrakis Methane.\nRelated Stories\n  \n\nI Tried Kiehl’s Viral "Liquid Pimple Patch" on My Hormonal Breakout\n\n  \n\nLive by Acne Patches?

Salicylic acid was my go to before, but this works better. It will usually zap baby pimples overnight and for bigger ones, it calms and prevents them from worsening and they go away in 2-4 days. It\'s clear, easy to apply, no odor. I\'ve even used the tiniest amount on rosacea pimples, followed by cica gel, without irritation. For reference, I get hormonal adult pimples and have mild rosacea. I\'m really happy with this product.\n5 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tA La\n2.0 out of 5 stars\n Poor Design\nReviewed in the United States on July 31, 2023\nVerified Purchase\nI think the formula is good at working as advertised, but I was only able to use it a handful of times. The packaging design is very flawed - the pen works by clicking the end, but there is no lock function so you can click the end in so many ways. Picking it up and putting it down but most of all, just having it in a bag while traveling. I will not buy again since I only got seven applications before it ran out, with so much of the product stuck in the cap of the pen from being pushed out while not in use.\n3 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tJacque96\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n This was a lifesaver.

I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month.\xa0\n\nLucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I\'ll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.\n\nKeep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.\n\nCOSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH\n\nBEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types\n\nKEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid\n\nPRICE: $19\n\nABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.\n\nAbout My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts\n\nMy skin can be unpredictable. But, as I\'ve gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.\xa0\xa0\n\nIngredients: One key, familiar ingredient\xa0\n\nThe tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.\n\nThe Feel: Like a bandage\n\nYou can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Packaging: Easy to store\n\nThe 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish\n\nI placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.\n\nEven with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn\'t budge overnight.\n\nIf you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn\'t expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn\'t gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don\'t believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Value: Worth it\n\nWas this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nSimilar Products: You\'ve got options\xa0\n\nsquish.

One of the most recent tools to gain popularity is the acne or pimple patch, a thin circular or triangular patch made from hydrocolloid that claims to help clear acne faster than it could clear up on its own.\n\nBut do they work? The answer is a murky yes. Pimple patches do help speed the healing process, but not necessarily for the reasons you might assume.\n\nHow Do Pimple Patches Work?\n\nAt their most basic, pimple patches are wound care, Geeta Yadav, MD, dermatologist and founder of FACET Dermatology in Toronto, Canada, told Verywell. There are two basic categories of patches: traditional patches that work by covering and protecting the lesion with a hydrocolloid membrane, and those that have additional ingredients or technology such as microneedles or topical treatments like salicylic acid.\n\n“Hydrocolloid is really used in wound care. It can seal over broken skin or something wet and draw the fluid out of the lesion,” Yadav said. “In a pimple setting, it draws out the sebum or pus out of the pimples and promote faster healing.”\n\nPatches with added ingredients can help by additionally speeding the exfoliation process, which clears away dead skin and sebum, revealing healthier skin underneath. While the added ingredients are useful, Yadav said that the most important functionality is protecting the wound from your own prying fingers.\n\n“Everyone picks,” she said. “One of the best features of having a patch, whether it has active ingredients or not, is that every time you go to touch that pimple, it’s protected from your own hands and the bacteria that you might have under your nails or anything that might make it flare.”\n\n How to Heal a Big Pimple That Won\'t Go Away\nHow Effective Are Pimple Patches?\n\nA single-center, randomized clinical trial completed by Johnson & Johnson in 2021 indicated that using a pimple patch for one week on either popped or unpopped pimples did improve the look of pimples. The study also revealed that popped pimples healed faster using hydrocolloid patches than those that healed without.\xa0\n\nWhile hydrocolloid patches alone aren’t adding any drying agents to the skin, they are creating an atmosphere of healing. If patients have had success with other topical solutions, they can also apply those before using a hydrocolloid patch, said Asmi Sanghvi, MD, dermatologist and clinical instructor at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City\n\n“If you plan to apply a topical treatment underneath an acne patch, the occlusive nature of the patch will help that treatment penetrate deeper and more intensely,” Sanghvi told Verywell. “This is fine as long as the topical treatment isn’t irritating to the skin—so topical clindamycin or topical azelaic acid are fine. However, if the topical treatment is a retinoid, salicylic acid, or benzoyl peroxide, it could potentially lead to inflammation and irritation of the normal skin.”\n\n What to Know About Topical Retinoids for Acne\nWhen to Use a Pimple Patch\n\nYadav said that the best time to start using a pimple patch is when you first start to see a pimple form, especially if the patch contains active ingredients.\n\nEven if the pimple is fully formed, though, there are still benefits to using a patch. The less that you touch the affected area, the faster it will heal. Even if you’ve already popped the pimple, covering it with a protective patch is a good idea.\n\nHow to Choose the Right Pimple Patch\n\n\nThe field of options for pimple patches has grown considerably over the last few years, and now there are many to choose from. Here are a few key criteria to consider.\xa0\n\nPrice: Most pimple patches come in packs, and packs start as little as $6 for 24 patches of various sizes to $30.\nActive ingredients: Hydrocolloid alone is helpful in healing. But some patches include salicylic acid, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and a host of other ingredients. If you have sensitive skin, it may be best to start with hydrocolloid only.\nSize and shape: Some patches come with a variety of sized patches or different shapes to fit on different areas of the face.\nSkin tone: Most patches offer translucent options, but you’ll want to make sure they blend with your skin tone if you plan to wear them during the day. Or go bold and choose a patch with a pattern on the surface. Sanghvi said that she prefers the Mighty Patch Invisible since it blends with nearly any skin tone.\nPotential Side Effects\xa0\n\nSince hydrocolloid patches only create a protective environment, there are few side effects, but patches with added ingredients can cause sensitivity depending on your skin type. Sanghvi said that patches with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid may leave red marks on the skin where the patch was on those with sensitive skin.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nPimple patches are the bandages of skincare. When used as such, they are an effective way to keep your pimple clean and free from bacteria. For those with sensitive skin, start with a patch that doesn’t include additional ingredients and see if they work for you. They won’t cure acne overnight, but they may prevent scarring by preventing you from picking and damaging your skin.\n\nBy Rachel Murphy\nRachel Murphy is a Kansas City, MO, journalist with more than 10 years of experience.\n\nSee Our Editorial Process\nMeet Our Medical Expert Board\nShare Feedback\nRelated Articles\nRemoving Whiteheads Based on What Causes Them\nAcne Treatment Based on Acne Type\nThe 13 Best Acne Spot Treatments of 2023\nHow to Get Rid of Pimples for Clearer Skin\nThe 10 Best Melasma Treatments to Fade Dark Spots for Every Skin Type\nThe 15 Best Face Exfoliators to Renew Your Skin\nHow to Pop a Pimple: Safety, Side Effects, and Other Solutions\nThe Best Benzoyl Peroxide Face Washes For Clear Skin\nDoes Salicylic Acid Help Psoriasis?\nBenzoyl Peroxide Side Effects\nWhy Is My Skin so Sensitive?\nThe 12 Best Face Washes for All Skin Types—Find the Perfect One for You\n11 Best Acne Treatment Tips for Teens\nThe 9 Best Scar Creams, Tested and Reviewed\nWhat Is the Best Treatment for Melasma?\nThe 7 Best Ceramide Moisturizers, According to Dermatologists\nDaily Health Tips to Your Inbox\n\nEmail Address\nSIGN UP\nHealth A-Z\nPrevention & Treatment\nHealth Care\nNews\nMeet Our Medical Expert Board\nAbout Us\nEditorial Process\nDiversity Pledge\nPrivacy Policy\nIn the News\nAdvertise\nTerms of Service\nCareers\nContact\nFollow Us\nVerywell Health\'s content is for informational and educational purposes only.

Dermatologists Share the Best 15 Brands of 2023\n\nWith faves from Hero Cosmetics, Peace Out, Clearasil, and more.\n\nby THERESA HOLLAND UPDATED ON 09/13/23 04:02PM\nmedically reviewed by LILY TALAKOUB, MD, FAAD Board-Certified Dermatologist\nfact checked by ANNA HARRIS\nWe independently evaluate all recommended products and services. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn more.\n\nBYRDIE / JACLYN MASTROPASQUA\n\nThere\'s no shortage of over-the-counter products for clearing breakouts. But when you only have one or two zits at any given time, there\'s no need to treat your entire face. Enter the pimple patch, a targeted way to zap acne without exposing the rest of your skin to undue drying or irritation. According to board-certified dermatologist Sheilagh Maguiness, MD, acne patches typically contain hydrocolloid gel,1 which is often used in wound care. Hydrocolloid patches are able to keep the spot moist in order to accelerate healing and protect. In addition to healing blemishes, Dr. Maguiness notes, "The hydrocolloid in the acne sticker can help absorb sebum and dirt."\xa0\n\nClaire Wolinsky, MD, a New York dermatologist specializing in facial rejuvenation, says she loves pimple patches and recommends them frequently: "One reason they are particularly helpful in treating acne is because once covered, patients can\'t pick or squeeze their pimple, which reduces the risk of infection and bacteria." And with less trauma to the skin, Dr. Wolinsky says you\'re less likely to experience scarring or discoloration.\n\nWe conducted hours of research on the best acne patches, evaluating each on active ingredients to target acne as well as ingredients to soothe skin and prevent redness. We also looked at things like how easy they are to apply and how well they stay on. After considering dozens of brands and consulting with two celebrity dermatologists, we landed on the following best in show.\n\n\nOur Top Picks\nBEST OVERALL:\nPeace Out Acne Dots at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST BUDGET:\nSoko Glam The Klog at Sokoglam.com\nJump to Review\nBEST DRUGSTORE:\nClearasil Ultra Overnight Spot Patches at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST SPLURGE:\nPeter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST K-BEAUTY:\nCOSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST FOR DEEP PIMPLES:\nZitSticka Killa Kit at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST FOR SCARRING:\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch The Original at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST MULTI-INGREDIENT:\nAvarelle Acne Cover Patch at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST WITH SALICYLIC ACID:\nDime Beauty Co.

"They employ hydrocolloid2 technology that helps extract impurities and guards against external elements," he explains. What\'s more, the patches create a barrier between pimples and your bacteria-laden fingers while delivering a time-released infusion of ingredients.\n\nCosmetic nurse Kristina Kitsos is also a fan of Peace Out. "They contain salicylic acid,3 which penetrates pores to target acne blemishes and blackheads," she tells Byrdie. Additionally, Kitsos appreciates that these acne patches contain soothing aloe vera to minimize redness and skin-clearing standby vitamin A (aka retinol).4 She says that since they\'re formulated with hydrating ingredients, the skin is able to heal quicker and better than if a drying, alcohol formula was used.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nIf you have skin that dries out or breaks easily, this is a great pick because of the inclusion of aloe vera—which can soothe and hydrate. Even pimple patches can sometimes tear the sensitive skin around a blemish, but you won\'t have to worry about that with these.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $19\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid, salicylic acid, aloe, retinol | Amount: 10 to 40 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\nBest BudgetSoko Glam The Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch\n\nSoko Glam\n\nVIEW ON SOKOGLAM.COM\nWhat We Like\n\nBudget-friendly\n\nLong-lasting adhesive\n\nIncludes two sizes\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nThinner patch than other options\n\nWhile most pimple patches aren\'t very pricey, The Klog\'s Soft Shield is one of the budget-friendliest of the bunch. Containing vegan hydrocolloid,2 the protective yet breathable barrier draws out impurities and helps your zits heal as quickly as possible.\xa0We love that these super-thin patches are almost invisible—perfect for wear during the day. They\'re unnoticeable whether you\'re in a virtual meeting or on a walk, and they\'ll keep your skin shielded from bacteria (and your fingers).\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nThese pimple patches can be super helpful for those who find it hard to stop themselves from picking since they are so lightweight they can be worn anytime. They\'re also great for people on a budget or for those looking for a vegan formula patch.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $6\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 42 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\n\nBest DrugstoreClearasil Ultra Overnight Spot Patches\n\nAmazon\n\nVIEW ON AMAZON\nVIEW ON TARGET\nVIEW ON WALMART\nWhat We Like\n\nBudget-friendly\n\nWorks overnight\n\nNon-drying\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nOnly one size\n\nA few drugstore brands have hopped on the pimple-patch bandwagon, but the best iteration comes from acne-fighting all-star Clearasil. Stick on the Spot Patches before bed, get your beauty sleep, and wake up to noticeable improvements in the size and redness of your blemishes. These patches have thinner, smooth edges, so they\'re able to adhere to the skin better without budging.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nIf you\'re a wild sleeper and often wake up to your pimple patch on your pillow, we recommend these.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $14\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 18 patches | Cruelty-Free: No\n\n\nBest SplurgePeter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots\n\nSephora\n\nVIEW ON AMAZON\nVIEW ON ULTA\nVIEW ON WALMART\nWhat We Like\n\nContains skin-clearing and moisturizing ingredients\n\nIncludes two sizes\n\nComes with tin container\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nDoesn\'t contain hydrocolloid\n\nPeter Thomas Roth\'s take on the acne patch is the super-moisturizing Invisible Dots. In addition to acne-clearing mainstays salicylic acid5 and tea tree oil,6 they call on hyaluronic acid7 to deliver much-needed moisture to the bumps that lie beneath. These aren\'t hydrocolloid patches, so they won\'t absorb the gunk out of a pimple that\'s already come to a head.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nWe recommend these patches for big, red pimples that you want to reduce in size quickly. They can work overnight to greatly shrink blemishes.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $32\n\nActive Ingredients: Salicylic acid, tea tree oil, hyaluronic acid | Amount: 32 patches | Cruelty-Free: No\n\n\n The 13 Best Acne Face Washes of 2023\nBest K-BeautyCOSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch\n\nAmazon\n\nVIEW ON AMAZON\nVIEW ON ULTA\nVIEW ON WALMART\n I Reviewed The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch And Saw Visible Overnight Results\nWhat We Like\n\nMade without irritating ingredients\n\n\nIncludes three sizes\n\n\nDermatologist-recommended\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nMore effective on pimples that have come to a head\n\nDr. Wolinsky is a fan of COSRX Master Patches, and we\'re here for it. Serving up a heaping dose of hydrocolloid8 underneath each hygienic sticker, you can target even the most stubborn bumps with little effort. We also like that these Korean patches come in three different sizes.\n\nWhen we tested them for ourselves, we loved that they didn\'t budge while we slept (even when applied over our nighttime serums). The pimple was noticeably smaller in the morning, and the patches kept the blemish from becoming irritated during use.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nThese patches come in three different sizes to best fit whatever type of pimple you have. This is a great choice if you deal with frequent acne of all kinds and need a patch that can fit both smaller and larger blemishes.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $6\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 32 to 96 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nBest for Deep PimplesZitSticka Killa Kit\n\nAmazon\n\nVIEW ON AMAZON\nVIEW ON ULTA\nVIEW ON VERISHOP.COM\nWhat We Like\n\nPenetrates deeper blemishes\n\nComes with cleansing swabs\n\nContains skin-clearing ingredients\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nSmall amount of patches\n\nThere\'s not much you can do about a deep pimple brewing underneath your skin—outside of placing a ZitSticka on it. The self-dissolving microdarts get to the root of the problem and prevent bumps from getting any bigger. With continued use, the blemish will become smaller without leaving a scar behind.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nWe recommend these patches for those with cystic acne that refuses to come to a head, as the mini microneedles can target the deep pimples that sit under the skin.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $29\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid, salicylic acid, hyaluronic acid | Amount: 4 to 8 patches | Cruelty-Free: 8 patches\n\n The 15 Best Acne Spot Treatments to Zap Pimples Fast\nBest for ScarringHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch The Original\n\nAmazon\n\nVIEW ON AMAZON\nVIEW ON ULTA\nVIEW ON TARGET\nWhat We Like\n\nHelps prevent scarring\n\nNot bubbly\n\nIncludes day and night patches\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nNot ideal for cystic acne\n\nWhen it comes to pimple patches, Dr. Maguiness and Dr. Wolinsky agree on the Mighty Patch. A home run for all skin types, this pack of acne patches includes a flat, invisible option for daytime and a more conspicuous overnight sticker, each containing hydrocolloid8 to expedite healing and prevent acne scarring. They work quickly (in about 6 hours) to noticeably flatten the spot so that a scar doesn\'t have time to appear.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nIf you have blemishes that easily scar even when you don\'t pick or prod at them, we love these patches that can help stop scars from forming.\n\n\nPrice at time of publish: $11\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 36 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\n The 14 Best Acne Scar Treatments of 2023\nBest Multi-IngredientAvarelle Acne Cover Patch\n\nAmazon\n\nVIEW ON AMAZON\nVIEW ON WALMART\nVIEW ON CVS\nWhat We Like\n\nBudget-friendly\n\nWorks for deep pimples\n\nDermatologist-recommended\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nNot ideal for sensitive skin\n\nDr. Wolinsky also likes Avarelle. Along with hydrocolloid,2 the brand\'s all but invisible Acne Cover Patch is chock full of plant-based healing ingredients and skin-clearing favorites like tea tree oil,6 Centella Asiatica (aka cica),9 and calendula.10\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nIf you\'re someone who has skin that gets irritated easily or you just simply don\'t like using a lot of products, these patches are great to keep on hand because they\'re able to soothe and heal a blemish completely—all while preventing bacteria from touching it.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $9\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid, tea tree oil, calendula, centella asiatica | Amount: 40 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\n\nBest With Salicylic AcidDime Beauty Co.

These patches are the ones that you\'ll want to try to get those hard-to-reach blemishes. It has a two-step process: swipe the pad (which is infused with tea tree oil and salicylic acid) on clean skin and then apply the patch directly to the blemish. It\'s made with super-fine microneedles so that the ingredients are able to penetrate the skin better, and the patch is also formulated with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and peptides to hydrate and heal the affected area and effectively flatten the pimple.\n\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nIf you\'ve tried everything for hormonal acne and are looking for a targeted, effective treatment without taking a trip to the dermatologist, these are a great pick.

If you have a blemish that you feel the need to conceal during the day, we recommend reaching for these patches from Rael. They have super thin edges that stick onto the skin seamlessly and lay as flat as possible for a hydrocolloid patch. Even though they\'re less noticeable than others on the market, they\'re still just as effective at protecting from bacteria and removing impurities from the spot overnight.\n\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nPicking at your skin is a hard habit to break, but it\'s necessary in order to not make blemishes worse and create a scar. Wearing a pimple patch throughout the day can help, and these patches from Rael will go unnoticed while you\'re out with friends or even at work.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $17\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 96 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\nWhere We Stand\n\nThe best pimple patches overall are Peace Out Acne Healing Dots. They contain hydrocolloid, and also a blend of soothing and clearing ingredients like retinol, salicylic acid, and aloe. For a more affordable option, consider The Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch, a breathable yet protective solution that draws out impurities and speeds up healing.\n\nWhat to Look for When Buying Acne Patches\nHydrocolloid: "The most important thing is that the stickers or patches are made of hydrocolloid," Dr. Wolinsky tells Byrdie, which is "something dermatologists have used for wound care for a long time." The healing ingredient seals the skin underneath the patch while absorbing fluid, flattening bumps, and minimizing inflammation.8Some options, like Peach Slices Acne Spot Dots, are made with nothing more than hydrocolloid, which does an excellent job taking care of pimples on its own.\nActive Ingredients: Most acne patches utilize hydrocolloid, which can be very effective on its own. However, you\'ll also find options containing a range of other acne-fighting ingredients. As Dr. Wolinsky notes, "Some of these patches have salicylic acid, which may help further treat a nasty breakout." Additionally, you might see soothing aloe vera extract,14 resurfacing retinol,4 complexion-clearing tea tree oil,15 or hydrating hyaluronic acid12 on the ingredients list.\nDime Beauty Power Patches are an excellent choice if you\'re looking for something containing salicylic acid, and Peter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots are a great option with tea tree oil. Some patches, like Mario Badescu Drying Patches, contain both.\nSize: Since pimples and breakouts come in all shapes and sizes, it\'s nice to have a couple of different acne patches to work with. While many brands offer only one size, some packs include two or even three sizes to cover large and small zits accordingly. For instance, The Klog\'s Soft Shield Pimple Patches come with two sizes. You\'ll also find extra-large patches, which are meant to cover multi-bump breakouts.\nFAQ\nHow do acne patches work?\n\n"Most acne patches work by providing a moist occluded environment so that the acne lesion can heal underneath," says Dr. Maguiness. They typically contain hydrocolloid,8 which, as Dr. Wolinsky explains, absorbs the inflammatory fluid, flattens the bump, and speeds up healing. "The added bonus is that they keep fingers off and prevent picking," notes Dr. Maguiness.\n\n\nHow do you apply acne patches?\n\nStarting with freshly washed hands and clean, dry skin, carefully peel the patch off the sheet. Then, gently stick it on the pimple in question, aligning the center of the patch with the center of the pimple. Leave it on for 12 to 24 hours or until it turns opaque.\n\n\nHow often should you use acne patches?\n\nGenerally speaking, you can use acne patches as often as needed. Since they target only a very small portion of your skin, you shouldn\'t have to worry about irritating the rest of your face or neck. In some cases, you might need to use two or three consecutive patches to get rid of a particularly stubborn pimple.\n\n\nWhy Trust Byrdie\n\nTheresa Holland is a skincare devotee and commerce writer specializing in beauty, lifestyle, and wellness.

And some patches can cause skin irritation.\xa0\n\nTalk to your dermatologist about the best treatment appropriate for your skin and acne type.\n\nAnastasiia Zabolotna/iStock via Getty Images Plus\n\nFew things are more frustrating than a glaring pimple on your face. Whether you’re dealing with one zit or an acne breakout, you’ve likely researched ways to get rid of pimples.\n\nEnter pimple patches — also called acne patches or zit stickers. These popular patches are small, thin stickers that promise flatter acne and clearer skin. While they may be helpful, pimple patches don’t work on all types of acne.\n\nHow effective are pimple patches?\n\nWhen used correctly, pimple patches can be an effective and convenient solution to treat certain types of pimples.\n\nA small study found that hydrocolloid patches effectively reduced redness, oily secretion, and dark spots in people with mild or moderate acne. Another study suggests people with facial acne had less acne and dark pigmentation after using dissolving microneedle patches for 28 days. But, these were small trials, and more research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of pimple patches.\n\nStill, most of the benefits of pimple patches may be from their protective barrier property. If you’re dealing with acne, you were likely told that pimple popping is a no-no.\xa0\n\nThat’s because squeezing or popping your acne can cause it to take longer to clear and result in dark spots and scarring. With a pimple patch on and by keeping your hands off your zits, you’re allowing your skin the chance to heal naturally, all while lowering your risk of infection.\n\nBut, some people may not see any results after using pimple patches. Pimple patches only work on the surface level of your skin and are not appropriate for all types of pimples. And since there are many types of patches — like non-medicated, medicated, and microneedle patches — you need the right patch for your acne.\n\nFor example, patches that contain hydrocolloid only may work for acne that has a “head” or has popped. But those with added anti-acne ingredients may be more appropriate for those red and inflamed pimples. And if you’re struggling with acne cysts, which are deeper in the skin, pimple patches may not be effective.\n\nIn any case, it’s best to see a dermatologist to figure out the best treatment for your acne, pimples, and skin breakouts.\n\nHow do pimple patches work?\n\nPimple patches work by absorbing excess oil and pus from pimples. They essentially shrink the zits and lessen inflammation. They’re commonly made of hydrocolloid, a gel-forming material originally used for wound healing. Hydrocolloid may draw out impurities from pimples while providing a moist environment that can help acne spots heal faster.\n\nA pimple patch can also lower the risk of your pimple getting infected — or re-infected — because it creates a protective barrier. When you have a pimple patch on, you’re less likely to pick at the area and introduce bacteria.\n\nAlong with hydrocolloid, some pimple patches are medicated with acne-fighting ingredients, like:\n\nSalicylic acid\n\nBenzoyl peroxide\n\nGlycolic acid\n\nNiacinamide\n\nSome types of patches have dissolving microneedles that slightly puncture the skin’s surface to allow the added ingredients to penetrate the skin.\n\nYou can buy pimple patches without a prescription online or over the counter (OTC) in a store.\n\nThese patches come in various shapes and sizes and can be applied during the day or at night, followed by the rest of your skincare routine.\n\nMost pimple patches are transparent, which means they’re invisible and can be worn under makeup. But, if you’re looking for something more fun — like a bright yellow star-shaped zit sticker — that’s also available.\n\nWhat are the side effects of pimple patches?\n\nWhile pimple patches are generally safe, they may cause side effects such as:\n\nSkin irritation: You may see redness or dryness around the area where the patch is applied. This is especially true for patches with added ingredients to treat acne.\n\nAllergic reaction: It’s possible to develop an allergic reaction to the materials used in the patch. For example, the adhesive or any of the acne-fighting medications in the patch may aggravate your skin or cause hyperpigmentation.\n\nAlthough extremely rare, some people have had serious allergic reactions to acne products. Get medical care right away if you develop symptoms like:\n\nTrouble breathing\n\nFace, eye, lip, or tongue swelling\n\nHives\n\nTightness in your throat\n\nWant to try pimple patches? Your dermatologist can help you pick the best pimple patch based on your skin type and acne.\n\nIf seeing a dermatologist is not an option, do a patch test first. Start by applying one pimple patch for a few hours to see how your skin reacts before moving on to a larger area. If you experience any reactions, stop using the patch and let your healthcare provider know right away.\n\nHow do you use pimple patches?\n\nPimple patches are quite easy to use. Follow these steps for the best results:\n\nCleanse and completely dry your skin.\n\nMake sure your hands are also clean to avoid contaminating the patch and your skin.\n\nSelect the appropriate patch size.\n\nPeel off the patch taking care not to touch its center.\n\nApply the patch directly over the spot.\n\nLeave the patch on based on the instructions on the package.\n\nPeel off the patch and discard.\n\nWash the area and apply a new patch if needed.\n\nHow long do you have to use pimple patches to get results?\n\nMost pimple patches can be used and changed as needed until the pimple has fully healed — which may take a few days. The duration depends on many factors, such as:\n\nThe type of patch you’re using\n\nThe type of acne being treated\n\nYour skin type\n\nThe manufacturer’s recommendations\n\nHow long you need to wear a patch will vary by brand. Microneedle and medicated pimple batches need to be worn for at least several hours. Non-medicated hydrocolloid patches may be worn for 2 to 3 days, as long as you change the patch every day.\n\nRemember to cleanse and dry the area before applying a new patch. For the best results, follow the directions specific to the patch you’re using.\n\nWho should not use pimple patches?\n\nIt’s better to avoid using pimple patches if you have sensitive skin. This is also true if you’re allergic to adhesive or any acne product that may have been added to the patch. In this case, don’t use pimple patches, and discuss your treatment options with your dermatologist.\n\nIf you’re breaking out a lot or have more serious acne, pimple patches may not be your best option. You may need stronger OTC or prescription medications.\n\nAlternatives to pimple patches\n\nIf using a pimple patch is not an option for you, consider these alternatives and tips to manage your acne:\n\nTopical acne treatments: These include OTC benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid that can be applied directly to the acne or your entire face. They help get rid of dead skin cells and kill bacteria. You can also try using an OTC retinoid, like adapalene (Differin), to help unclog pores. Just keep in mind adapalene is not a spot treatment. It needs to be used for at least 4 to 6 weeks for best results.\n\nOral medications: Antibiotics or isotretinoin (Absorica) can be prescribed by a dermatologist to help clear up cystic acne. Birth control pills and spironolactone (Aldactone) are treatment options that also need a prescription.\n\nGood skin care: Use a gentle cleanser to wash your skin. Choose skin care products that are free of oil and alcohol and won’t clog pores (non-comedogenic).\n\nHands off: Resist the urge to pop or squeeze your acne and avoid touching your face throughout the day.\n\nBeing patient: It may take a few weeks to see results, so give your treatment time to work.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWhile they’re not a long-term solution, pimple patches may help lessen the appearance and duration of your pimples. But they don’t work on all types of acne.\n\nWhen choosing a pimple patch, be sure to read the ingredients and follow the instructions carefully. If you’re unsure which pimple patch is appropriate for you or if you have sensitive skin, talk to your dermatologist before using these patches.\n\nReferences\n\nAbrahamson, R. P. (2020).

But when you only have one or two zits at any given time, there\'s no need to treat your entire face. Enter the pimple patch, a targeted way to zap acne without exposing the rest of your skin to undue drying or irritation. According to board-certified dermatologist Sheilagh Maguiness, MD, acne patches typically contain hydrocolloid gel,1 which is often used in wound care. Hydrocolloid patches are able to keep the spot moist in order to accelerate healing and protect. In addition to healing blemishes, Dr. Maguiness notes, "The hydrocolloid in the acne sticker can help absorb sebum and dirt."\xa0\n\nClaire Wolinsky, MD, a New York dermatologist specializing in facial rejuvenation, says she loves pimple patches and recommends them frequently: "One reason they are particularly helpful in treating acne is because once covered, patients can\'t pick or squeeze their pimple, which reduces the risk of infection and bacteria." And with less trauma to the skin, Dr. Wolinsky says you\'re less likely to experience scarring or discoloration.\n\nWe conducted hours of research on the best acne patches, evaluating each on active ingredients to target acne as well as ingredients to soothe skin and prevent redness. We also looked at things like how easy they are to apply and how well they stay on. After considering dozens of brands and consulting with two celebrity dermatologists, we landed on the following best in show.\n\n\nOur Top Picks\nBEST OVERALL:\nPeace Out Acne Dots at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST BUDGET:\nSoko Glam The Klog at Sokoglam.com\nJump to Review\nBEST DRUGSTORE:\nClearasil Ultra Overnight Spot Patches at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST SPLURGE:\nPeter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST K-BEAUTY:\nCOSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST FOR DEEP PIMPLES:\nZitSticka Killa Kit at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST FOR SCARRING:\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch The Original at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST MULTI-INGREDIENT:\nAvarelle Acne Cover Patch at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST WITH SALICYLIC ACID:\nDime Beauty Co.

"They employ hydrocolloid2 technology that helps extract impurities and guards against external elements," he explains. What\'s more, the patches create a barrier between pimples and your bacteria-laden fingers while delivering a time-released infusion of ingredients.\n\nCosmetic nurse Kristina Kitsos is also a fan of Peace Out. "They contain salicylic acid,3 which penetrates pores to target acne blemishes and blackheads," she tells Byrdie. Additionally, Kitsos appreciates that these acne patches contain soothing aloe vera to minimize redness and skin-clearing standby vitamin A (aka retinol).4 She says that since they\'re formulated with hydrating ingredients, the skin is able to heal quicker and better than if a drying, alcohol formula was used.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nIf you have skin that dries out or breaks easily, this is a great pick because of the inclusion of aloe vera—which can soothe and hydrate. Even pimple patches can sometimes tear the sensitive skin around a blemish, but you won\'t have to worry about that with these.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $19\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid, salicylic acid, aloe, retinol | Amount: 10 to 40 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\nBest BudgetSoko Glam The Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch\n\nSoko Glam\n\nVIEW ON SOKOGLAM.COM\nWhat We Like\n\nBudget-friendly\n\nLong-lasting adhesive\n\nIncludes two sizes\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nThinner patch than other options\n\nWhile most pimple patches aren\'t very pricey, The Klog\'s Soft Shield is one of the budget-friendliest of the bunch. Containing vegan hydrocolloid,2 the protective yet breathable barrier draws out impurities and helps your zits heal as quickly as possible.\xa0We love that these super-thin patches are almost invisible—perfect for wear during the day. They\'re unnoticeable whether you\'re in a virtual meeting or on a walk, and they\'ll keep your skin shielded from bacteria (and your fingers).\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nThese pimple patches can be super helpful for those who find it hard to stop themselves from picking since they are so lightweight they can be worn anytime. They\'re also great for people on a budget or for those looking for a vegan formula patch.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $6\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 42 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\n\nBest DrugstoreClearasil Ultra Overnight Spot Patches\n\nAmazon\n\nVIEW ON AMAZON\nVIEW ON TARGET\nVIEW ON WALMART\nWhat We Like\n\nBudget-friendly\n\nWorks overnight\n\nNon-drying\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nOnly one size\n\nA few drugstore brands have hopped on the pimple-patch bandwagon, but the best iteration comes from acne-fighting all-star Clearasil. Stick on the Spot Patches before bed, get your beauty sleep, and wake up to noticeable improvements in the size and redness of your blemishes. These patches have thinner, smooth edges, so they\'re able to adhere to the skin better without budging.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nIf you\'re a wild sleeper and often wake up to your pimple patch on your pillow, we recommend these.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $14\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 18 patches | Cruelty-Free: No\n\n\nBest SplurgePeter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots\n\nSephora\n\nVIEW ON AMAZON\nVIEW ON ULTA\nVIEW ON WALMART\nWhat We Like\n\nContains skin-clearing and moisturizing ingredients\n\nIncludes two sizes\n\nComes with tin container\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nDoesn\'t contain hydrocolloid\n\nPeter Thomas Roth\'s take on the acne patch is the super-moisturizing Invisible Dots. In addition to acne-clearing mainstays salicylic acid5 and tea tree oil,6 they call on hyaluronic acid7 to deliver much-needed moisture to the bumps that lie beneath. These aren\'t hydrocolloid patches, so they won\'t absorb the gunk out of a pimple that\'s already come to a head.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nWe recommend these patches for big, red pimples that you want to reduce in size quickly.

Serving up a heaping dose of hydrocolloid8 underneath each hygienic sticker, you can target even the most stubborn bumps with little effort. We also like that these Korean patches come in three different sizes.\n\nWhen we tested them for ourselves, we loved that they didn\'t budge while we slept (even when applied over our nighttime serums). The pimple was noticeably smaller in the morning, and the patches kept the blemish from becoming irritated during use.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nThese patches come in three different sizes to best fit whatever type of pimple you have.

These patches are the ones that you\'ll want to try to get those hard-to-reach blemishes. It has a two-step process: swipe the pad (which is infused with tea tree oil and salicylic acid) on clean skin and then apply the patch directly to the blemish. It\'s made with super-fine microneedles so that the ingredients are able to penetrate the skin better, and the patch is also formulated with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and peptides to hydrate and heal the affected area and effectively flatten the pimple.\n\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nIf you\'ve tried everything for hormonal acne and are looking for a targeted, effective treatment without taking a trip to the dermatologist, these are a great pick.

If you have a blemish that you feel the need to conceal during the day, we recommend reaching for these patches from Rael. They have super thin edges that stick onto the skin seamlessly and lay as flat as possible for a hydrocolloid patch. Even though they\'re less noticeable than others on the market, they\'re still just as effective at protecting from bacteria and removing impurities from the spot overnight.\n\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nPicking at your skin is a hard habit to break, but it\'s necessary in order to not make blemishes worse and create a scar. Wearing a pimple patch throughout the day can help, and these patches from Rael will go unnoticed while you\'re out with friends or even at work.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $17\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 96 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\nWhere We Stand\n\nThe best pimple patches overall are Peace Out Acne Healing Dots. They contain hydrocolloid, and also a blend of soothing and clearing ingredients like retinol, salicylic acid, and aloe. For a more affordable option, consider The Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch, a breathable yet protective solution that draws out impurities and speeds up healing.\n\nWhat to Look for When Buying Acne Patches\nHydrocolloid: "The most important thing is that the stickers or patches are made of hydrocolloid," Dr. Wolinsky tells Byrdie, which is "something dermatologists have used for wound care for a long time." The healing ingredient seals the skin underneath the patch while absorbing fluid, flattening bumps, and minimizing inflammation.8Some options, like Peach Slices Acne Spot Dots, are made with nothing more than hydrocolloid, which does an excellent job taking care of pimples on its own.\nActive Ingredients: Most acne patches utilize hydrocolloid, which can be very effective on its own. However, you\'ll also find options containing a range of other acne-fighting ingredients. As Dr. Wolinsky notes, "Some of these patches have salicylic acid, which may help further treat a nasty breakout." Additionally, you might see soothing aloe vera extract,14 resurfacing retinol,4 complexion-clearing tea tree oil,15 or hydrating hyaluronic acid12 on the ingredients list.\nDime Beauty Power Patches are an excellent choice if you\'re looking for something containing salicylic acid, and Peter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots are a great option with tea tree oil. Some patches, like Mario Badescu Drying Patches, contain both.\nSize: Since pimples and breakouts come in all shapes and sizes, it\'s nice to have a couple of different acne patches to work with. While many brands offer only one size, some packs include two or even three sizes to cover large and small zits accordingly. For instance, The Klog\'s Soft Shield Pimple Patches come with two sizes. You\'ll also find extra-large patches, which are meant to cover multi-bump breakouts.\nFAQ\nHow do acne patches work?\n\n"Most acne patches work by providing a moist occluded environment so that the acne lesion can heal underneath," says Dr. Maguiness. They typically contain hydrocolloid,8 which, as Dr. Wolinsky explains, absorbs the inflammatory fluid, flattens the bump, and speeds up healing. "The added bonus is that they keep fingers off and prevent picking," notes Dr. Maguiness.\n\n\nHow do you apply acne patches?\n\nStarting with freshly washed hands and clean, dry skin, carefully peel the patch off the sheet. Then, gently stick it on the pimple in question, aligning the center of the patch with the center of the pimple. Leave it on for 12 to 24 hours or until it turns opaque.\n\n\nHow often should you use acne patches?\n\nGenerally speaking, you can use acne patches as often as needed. Since they target only a very small portion of your skin, you shouldn\'t have to worry about irritating the rest of your face or neck. In some cases, you might need to use two or three consecutive patches to get rid of a particularly stubborn pimple.\n\n\nWhy Trust Byrdie\n\nTheresa Holland is a skincare devotee and commerce writer specializing in beauty, lifestyle, and wellness.

summary: Based on the information provided in the reference text, pimple patches, also known as acne patches or zit stickers, can be an effective and convenient solution for treating certain types of pimples. They work by absorbing excess oil and pus from pimples, shrinking the zits and reducing inflammation. Pimple patches create a protective barrier that lowers the risk of infection and prevents picking or squeezing the acne, which can lead to longer healing time and scarring.

However, the effectiveness of pimple patches can vary, and they may not work on all types of acne. Some patches, such as those containing hydrocolloid, may work for acne that has a "head" or has already popped. Patches with added anti-acne ingredients may be more suitable for red and inflamed pimples. Pimple patches may not be effective for deeper acne cysts.

It is recommended to consult a dermatologist to determine the best treatment for your specific acne type and skin condition. Pimple patches can be purchased without a prescription online or over the counter. They come in various shapes and sizes and can be worn during the day or at night. Most pimple patches are transparent and can be worn under makeup.

Possible side effects of pimple patches include skin irritation and allergic reactions. It is important to do a patch test before using a pimple patch, especially if you have sensitive skin or are allergic to adhesive or any acne-fighting ingredients in the patch.

The duration of using pimple patches depends on factors such as the type of patch, the type of acne being treated, your skin type, and the manufacturer's recommendations. Microneedle and medicated pimple patches may need to be worn for several hours, while non-medicated hydrocolloid patches can be worn for 2 to 3 days with daily patch changes.

In summary, pimple patches can be effective in treating certain types of pimples by absorbing excess oil and pus, reducing inflammation, and creating a protective barrier. However, their effectiveness may vary, and they may not work on all types of acne. It is best to consult a dermatologist for personalized treatment recommendations.

summary: Based on the reference information provided, I can respond to the question "gel acne patch side effects" with the following information:

The reference information states that hydrocolloid patches, which are commonly used as pimple patches, generally have few side effects. However, patches that contain added ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid may cause sensitivity and leave red marks on the skin for those with sensitive skin. It is recommended for individuals with sensitive skin to start with a patch that only contains hydrocolloid and see if it works for them. Overall, pimple patches are considered an effective way to keep pimples clean and free from bacteria, and they may prevent scarring by preventing individuals from picking and damaging their skin.

In summary, the side effects of gel acne patches are generally minimal, but patches with added ingredients may cause sensitivity and red marks on sensitive skin.
