Overview of AI Agents

An AI agent is a software application that automates tasks around the home, workplace, or any other environment. It’s an automated system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to learn from its experiences and interact with its environment in order to complete tasks.

AI agents can do anything from recognizing patterns in data sets, to controlling robotic arms as part of a production line, to playing board games like chess or go. Agents are often used in robotics applications because they can quickly process data and decisions while still being able to respond effectively when given certain conditions or requirements. Depending on their design, AI agents can be broadly classified into two main categories: reactive agents and goal-based agents.

Reactive agents are designed for simple tasks that don't require much cognitive effort. These types of agents receive sensory input from their environment and then react accordingly without any prior knowledge or planning. They don't need memories since they only respond to what is happening right now, making them great for short term goals such as automated customer service systems or robotics arms on factory floors.

Goal-based AI agents work differently than reactive ones by using learning algorithms such as reinforcement learning or deep learning techniques which allow them to form plans on how best to reach their goal efficiently. This type of agent requires long-term memory and understanding objectives in order to make decisions based on past experience instead of just responding directly each time it receives new information, making it better suited for more complex tasks requiring problem solving skills such as playing board games against another player or navigating autonomous cars through traffic safely.

Overall, AI agents are incredibly useful tools which can be used in a variety of different scenarios from navigation systems, robotics control systems, machine translation programs, virtual assistants; the possibilities are endless.

Why Use AI Agents?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents offer many advantages over traditional solutions. Here are a few reasons why AI agents are important and useful:

One way AI is becoming increasingly important is through its ability to automate tedious and time-consuming processes. Automation allows businesses to save time and money, while also increasing efficiency and accuracy in a variety of tasks. For example, AI bots can take on routine administrative responsibilities such as data entry or payment processing, freeing up employees’ time for other tasks that require more cognitive effort. Additionally, some industries rely entirely on machines for functions like automated customer service systems so customers can quickly receive answers to their questions without having to wait for human assistance.

AI also offers unique insights into diverse data sets through predictive analysis and machine learning algorithms which helps companies better understand consumers’ needs and desires so they can offer tailored experiences for each user. Businesses are able to use this information to optimize not only their products but how they interact with potential customers too, from personalizing content according to demographics or online behavior patterns, allowing them to create meaningful connections with customers every step of the way. This can also lead to improved marketing strategies resulting in increased sales conversions over time.

The applications of AI don’t stop there either; healthcare professionals are now leveraging this technology in order identify new treatments that could help patients fight disease faster than ever before, while transportation networks are optimizing urban traffic conditions by using connected vehicle intelligence combined with real-time environmental readings provided by smart infrastructure across many cities worldwide.

Features of AI Agents
Natural Language Processing: AI agents can process and understand natural language, allowing for human-like interactions between users and machines. This technology enables users to ask questions or give commands in their own language rather than having to learn a formal coding language.
Machine Learning: AI agents use machine learning algorithms to continuously improve their performance based on data they receive from previous experiences. Specifically, the agent’s algorithms are designed to allow it to adjust its behavior by taking in input data and creating an internal model that better suits the task at hand.
Adaptability: AI agents are able to adapt quickly with new tasks and information presented to them which helps ensure higher accuracy when dealing with different scenarios or environments. This makes them particularly well suited for situations where quick decisions need to be made with limited information provided as they can adjust their responses accordingly with every encounter they experience.
Autonomy/Self Sufficiency: AI agents typically require minimal human interaction because of their ability to independently perform complex tasks without need for direct supervision or guidance from humans; allowing them the freedom of self-sufficiency within certain boundaries imposed by their programming limitations and ethical standards set by society or local laws depending on its application(s).
Problem Solving Capabilities: AI agents have problem solving capabilities built into their algorithmic structure that allows them to work through problems faster than conventional methods used by humans thanks mainly due to their automated processes working much quicker than manually operated ones; results are generated quicker helping organizations make informed decisions quicker compared manual task automation techniques too.

We are hardly the first to claim a new technology is poised to upend work as we know it. With every wave of innovation comes a chorus of such pronouncements, many of which turn out to be hyperbole. Technology may make our jobs easier, but most of the time, the core of what we do remains fundamentally the same. But spend five minutes on ChatGPT, or any comparable Large Language Model (LLM), and it’s clear: it’s different.

The reason is simple. Most technologies help us accomplish tasks. They’re tools, a means of making us more productive. AI, on the other hand, can think (or at least, provide the appearance of thinking). It’s like having another knowledge worker on the payroll.

Activant Perspective 1: LLM-enabled software will autonomously accomplish highly complex tasks.

This is the beauty (and threat) of LLMs: they can do work we thought would long be the purview of humans.

Given this, one could be forgiven for worrying their job will soon be automated away by an AI. In the short term, this will lead to dislocation. But technological revolutions are never zero-sum – in fact, they’ve always been accretive. As workers adapt, they become more productive, and the companies they work for can do more with less. Some stop there, to be sure, but most businesses opt to invest the gains back into their infrastructure and people. In the end, revenues go up, and the economy grows.

That said, we’re still in the very first days of this cycle – and critically, of the technology itself.

Activant Perspective 2: LLMs alone are not enough to achieve Perspective 1.

Case in point: a large language model can’t complete most tasks on its own. After all, an LLM is merely a dense set of attention networks; essentially, statistics on a massive scale. Yes, they can engage in human-like “thought,” but to generate real value from any of these models, a human would have to integrate them into actual workflows – and make use of their decision-making prowess.

For example, imagine that you hired someone to lay bricks. You could lead them to a stack of bricks and explain where and how you want them laid. They could perfectly understand your instructions. Yet, understanding isn’t enough – the worker needs to be able to, well, lay bricks.

In this case, they need to have more than just cognition – they need to have arms, legs, and physical strength. Furthermore, they need a memory to recall how you wanted each of the bricks to be arranged, and a way of correcting any errors so they don’t cause the eventual structure to fail.1

Put another way, if LLMs are to extend beyond mere Q&A, they need (1) a suite of Tools to actually impact the real world, (2) memory repositories to remember what actions they’ve taken, and (3) auto-critique algorithms to error correct along the way.

When all these components come together, an “Agent” is born.

Technical Definition: An Agent is orchestration software that combines an LLM with memory, tools, and auto-critique algorithms.

Non-Technical Definition: An Agent is a highly advanced bot that can complete work that has been assigned to it in natural language.

Though still in their infancy, Agents are poised to fundamentally reshape the way we work. They will become natural extensions of your organization and complete day-to-day tasks – akin to hiring more employees. They’ll help you get work done, even collaborate with others on your behalf. Eventually, they’ll be able to work together, breaking down tasks into atoms of work able to be handled by a full “office” of Agents, some of which orchestrate, while others specialize.

The result is why this time is different: working together, Agents will be able to handle increasingly complex tasks, replacing knowledge workers in a variety of fields. As they do, what it means to work – and to lead – will change drastically, as both will increasingly depend on a mix of human and human-like capital.

Activant Perspective 3: Agent Teaming is the future of autonomously completed, complex work – and that future is possible today.

Few have sketched a path from where we are today, to the autonomous knowledge workers of the future. But that future is closer than you’d think, and one for which you almost certainly want a roadmap. To learn more about how this transformation will unfold, and how you can best position yourself within it, read on.

Research
The Agent Ecosystem 2

The Agent Ecosystem of the future has four key components:

LLMs (Large Language Models): provide “conscious thought” within AI Agents and have been trained on text data,
Tools: external APIs to facilitate task completion and Agent interaction with the real world,
Memory: includes various data storage mechanisms to retain and recall information, and
Self-Critique: the ability to correct mistakes when completing tasks.

To better understand the components, we imagine how each one might erode a job we know quite well: that of an analyst at Activant (sorry, John). Among many other things, we often rely on our analysts to create market maps, which requires them to:

Understand an industry,
Find companies that exist in that industry,
Compare these companies qualitatively, and
Place them on a 2-dimensional grid according to this comparison.

Until recently, this was almost inconceivable as a task for machines. Now, let’s explore how we’d put our “Agent Analyst” to use.

Thesis Map
AI Agent Ecosystem
1. Understanding the Industry (and the Task) – Large Language Models

For our Agent Analyst to understand the task at hand, it requires the capacity to comprehend instructions stated in natural language. While LLMs provide that ability, they come in many different shapes and sizes (literally). For that reason, here we outline a basic framework for evaluating LLM providers, including both foundational model providers and companies offering Fine-Tuning as-a-Service (FTaaS3).

When comparing foundational models, the number of parameters in a model is often a good approximation of output quality. As a rule of thumb, the more parameters a foundational model has, the better its performance across different benchmarks, such as reasoning, web browsing, or even game playing. Although fine-tuning a model can boost its performance on a particular task, larger models with more parameters tend to have better generalization skills – making them more useful.

As seen below, model sizes are increasing on an exponential basis with base 2, and although not pictured, model performance is similarly increasing – just not at the same rate.

Research
Foundational Models Size Map
Open vs. Closed Source LLMs

At the heart of any LLM lies its architecture: a blueprint dictating how various attention heads and layers are organized. Then, there are the "weights" — numeric values assigned to parameters in the neural network, refined and adjusted through training to enhance performance. Training involves feeding data into the model, allowing it to learn and make predictions, and then adjusting the weights based on its accuracy. It's through this process, often requiring substantial computational resources, that the model obtains its ability to understand and generate human-like text.

Open-source models, such as Llama 2 by Meta, “openly” share their architecture, weights, and sometimes even their training methodologies. This approach not only reveals the intricacies of their design but also democratizes access, allowing enterprises, researchers, and even enthusiasts to build upon, refine, or entirely repurpose these models for their own applications.

Conversely, some entities opt for a more guarded approach. Closed-source models, such as GPT-4 by OpenAI, often protect the details of their architecture, weights, or training processes, presenting them as somewhat of a black box. Instead of allowing direct model access, they employ APIs as intermediaries, thereby controlling and often monetizing the interaction between the end user and the model.

Market Map
Foundational Models
Provider Modality

“Provider Modality” relates to the data type a provider offers models for. This includes various transformations such as text-to-video, text-to-text, text-to-image, and image-to-text, among others. Companies that operate in just one domain are labeled as “Uni-Modal”; by contrast, “Multi-Modal” companies provide models spanning multiple domains. As Agents continue to evolve, we expect a growing emphasis on modality in LLM models, as those able to perform more diverse tasks and offer easier integrations will have a distinct advantage in the marketplace.

While Agents will no doubt depend on the Today, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic dominate the industry, but this is hardly set in stone. If anything, the next few years will see considerable competition, with whoever invests the most in R&D in a constant arms race. Given this uncertainty – and the promise of better models always around the bend – it’s hard to imagine Agents relying on a single provider. From an investment perspective, backing one LLM provider is essentially a vote of confidence in its R&D team, but past performance is not (necessarily) indicative of future results.

2. Finding Companies – Tools

Having understood the industry (and the task), the Agent Analyst now needs the ability to search for companies. In other words, the Agent Analyst needs a Tool.

Definition: Tools are snippets of code that foundational models can use to create, modify, and utilize external resources in order to execute tasks they couldn’t otherwise complete on their own.

Most Tools are problem specific. In this case, all the Agent Analyst needs is a connection to Google, or SerpAPI, a prominent wrapper for Google’s Search API. Unsurprisingly, other tasks will require different Tools. Game this out, and you quickly arrive at the need for Toolkits and Tool Aggregators. As tasks become more complex, Agents will rely on not one, but a variety of Tools to accomplish a single objective. Through Aggregators, Agents will be able to access the resources they need, programmatically, and as those needs arise.

Market Map
AI & LLM Tooling Companies

*More companies are launched every day- if we missed you...please reach out!

Single Tools

Single Tools refer to companies or services that specialize in just one function, such as searching the internet, booking a flight, or creating realistic voice audio files. While these offerings do have certain strengths, integrating them into a Toolbox, and thus into Agents, is often cumbersome. Notably, in prominent Agent libraries4 like LangChain, Toolboxes need to be set up before an Agent itself is even initialized. This means if there's a need to integrate additional Tools later – for example, if an Agent encounters a new task that requires a Tool outside of its preset toolkit – the Agent would have to initialized all over again. Given these considerations, embedding Single Tools into an Agent's workflow can be quite labor-intensive and time-consuming.

Market Map
AI Agent Tooling
Tool Aggregators

By contrast, Tool Aggregators offer Toolboxes-as-a-Service (TaaS). Theoretically, aggregators can compile an infinite number of Tools and distribute them via a single, unified API. In practice, they typically provide Tools that have been identified by an Agent as required to complete a given task. If an Agent requires determines it needs additional tools, however, it can access them without restarting.

Low-Code / No-Code (LCNC)

A subset of Tool aggregators, LCNC companies could provision Tools and/or provide tool-building functionality for Agents. As long as they offer an API, Agents can leverage these solutions as they do Tool Aggregators, integrating (and even custom-building) Tools into their workflows on the fly.

Automation

Why Using Internal Tools to do More with Less Matters Today
Read the Deep Dive

Many LCNC platforms have existed prior to the advent of LLMs and already have large libraries of powerful, ready-built Tools to draw upon. Several companies, including Relevance AI and Superblocks, have begun offering Agents-as-a-Service (AaaS), using these libraries to jump ahead of competitors, many of which are starting from scratch. Others may choose to offer APIs to facilitate quick adoption within the Agent Ecosystem and more reliably maintain their market share.

Because of their ease of integration and use, we believe Tool Aggregators and API-based LCNC platforms are the best positioned to take advantage of this new Agent ecosystem. As platforms like LlamaIndex and Relevance AI grow, Agents will be able to dynamically access a vast library of toolsets without needing to update their structure or code – increasing both their functionality and value.

3. Comparing Companies – Memory

As our Agent Analyst has progressed, it has gained the capability to discern tasks and search for companies. However, identifying a company means nothing if an Agent can’t remember it for later use. To facilitate this, Agents require a dedicated memory component that can store companies and their associated descriptions.

Market Map
Memory

Over the years, the software industry has seen a multitude of data-structure innovations, from traditional SQL-based relational tables to modern streaming services like Kafka. Yet, to truly grasp the intricacies of Agent development and the depth of virtual cognition, it's helpful to draw parallels with human memory.

At a high level, human memory is split into three core categories: sensory memory, short-term (or working) memory, and long-term memory.

Sensory Memory

In humans, sensory memory can be thought of as the direct inputs from our various senses — taste, smell, sight, touch, and hearing. These are perceived subconsciously, processed then filtered for relevance. Similarly, in the realm of Agents, sensory memory captures the responses generated from the Tools they employ. Research in neuroscience and psychology reveals that of the countless sensory inputs humans encounter every moment, only about 5% ascends to conscious awareness, courtesy of various attention mechanisms. Our neural framework efficiently filters out redundant and useless sensory data, elevating only important information for conscious processing. The sensory memory of an Agent operates on similar principles, sieving through vast data while retaining only what's significant.

For example, to store the names and descriptions of any relevant companies it finds, our Agent Analyst might choose to create a vector database. To do that, the Agent could use the Pinecone API and receive a specifically formatted JSON response directly. Though the Agent could use the LLM to parse that JSON response, it would be far more efficient for the Agent to use the Pinecone Tool from Llama Hub and receive a pre-processed Python dict. In many ways, this is analogous to how our subconscious mind pre-processes data before it needs to be consciously thought about – i.e. you don’t have to process the shoe touching your foot when you’re using your finger to touch your phone because your subconscious brain filters the shoe sensation out.

Over time, we believe that sensory memory will include the ingestion of many different data types, from unstructured data files (such as docx, pdf, epub, or recordings) to semi-structured datasets (such as messages and CRM data). As of today, it is unclear to us if “sensory” processing should or could be handled at the Tool level, like it is in the above Pinecone example, because we don’t know if Tool Aggregators will provide a standardized API for these tools – or if it’s even possible to have a standardized API across all conceivable Tools. What we do believe as a result of our work is that the quality of Agent-handled sensory memory will be highly correlated with the quality of the Agent itself.

Short-Term Memory

Having processed inputs on the subconscious level, Agents are left with the inputs which require conscious thought. In humans, conscious thoughts reside in working or short-term memory. When we actively think about a topic, we do not consciously remember the context for the thought in our “memory,” but it is nevertheless remembered. In fact, our short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about seven items5 and lasts for 20-30 seconds. For Agents, using the context windows defined by LLMs to store short-term memory is the default solution of most Agents we see today, and we don’t see that changing. As context windows increase in length and new techniques for prompt engineering solve existing constraints, the context window will be an even more effective location for short-term memory.

Interestingly, most short-term memory will be forgotten after a certain time threshold, especially after corresponding actions are finished. Though some of this information may be transitioned into long-term memory (which we discuss below), most of an Agent’s short-term memory will not be useful after a task is completed. Therefore, short-term memory data can be stored in the context and does not require the same complex storage techniques long-term memory does.

In the context of our Agent Analyst, short-term memory can be thought of as remembering the larger task at hand (i.e., creating a market map) when deciding what smaller task (i.e., finding a company) needs to be accomplished next. In practice, this information will largely live inside the context window of the LLM API call – and while it’s essential for the Agent to complete a task, we believe that there is little opportunity for investment in short-term memory due to the limited additional infrastructure required to build it.

Long-Term Memory

Once subconscious and conscious memory is in place, an Agent Analyst will need some way of saving information for longer periods than the immediate task at hand. This is where long-term memory comes into play.

In humans, long-term memory is finite, due to the limited capacity of the brain. As a result, we have developed two primary mechanisms to retain knowledge: repetition and adrenaline. For obvious reasons (i.e., they can use ACID databases), Agents lack this capacity constraint. Instead, they are limited by the amount of memory that they could conceivably “know” how to access. For example, if our Agent Analyst was integrated into our Drive and needed to search for the PowerPoint example of our Market Map, the size of the context window would limit the number of folders that it could select from in its search.

In our view, connections to long-term memory repositories are no different than Tools, in that they are blocks of code that can be executed and return a response.

Over the next decade, we believe that the entire ecosystem of data management will grow even faster than it has historically because of increased Agent data utilization. Agents will be able to build pipelines from company data, leverage it in their own processes, and integrate outside data into existing workflows. The total spend on databases and database management solutions doubled from $38.6B in 2017 to $80B in 20216. As the Agent ecosystem grows, the demand for data stores will increase even more rapidly, making the volumes of unstructured company data – which today sits untouched – significantly more valuable.

We’ve listed a handful of data structures, and the impact we anticipate from Agents, below:

4. Placing Company Logos – Auto-Critique

Our Agent Analyst has successfully understood the industry, used a search Tool to find all the companies within it, and saved them in a database for future output. As a final step, we need the Agent to place the logos of each of those companies onto an Activant Market Map – fully understanding the significance of each company’s position. Naturally, this will involve a Tool that enables the Agent to create graphs. In the short term, this Tool will likely be some wrapper around Our Agent Analyst has successfully understood the industry, used a search Tool to find all the companies within it, and saved them in a database for future output. As a final step, we need the Agent to place the logos of each of those companies onto an Activant Market Map – fully understanding the significance of each company’s position. Naturally, this will involve a Tool that enables the Agent to create graphs. In the short term, this Tool will likely be some wrapper around Matplotlib7 but in the long term, this will undoubtedly be an integration into PowerPoint.

Plotting logos, of course, is the easy part of the challenge; understanding where to place a logo in a subjective 2-dimensional plane is the truly complex task. It requires iterations, constant comparisons to other companies, and perhaps even outside input from the Activant team. Therefore, the Agent needs a mechanism for critiquing itself. We call this Auto-Critique.

While we foresee potential challenges - like defensibility - this remains a vital component of the ecosystem with several approaches underway: (A) Prompt Engineering, (B) Human-In-The-Loop, and (C) Auto-Critique.

Market Map
Self-Critique
A) Prompt Engineering

Definition: Prompt Engineering is the process of forming and refining natural language statements and questions to achieve an optimal outcome from an LLM.

In practice, LLMs are only capable of comprehending and responding to inputs that fit within a defined context window. For example, GPT4’s context window is about eight thousand tokens – meaning only about seven thousand words can be provided as context at any one time.8 In order to maximize the utility of the model, a prompt engineer could write shorter and more effective prompts.

In our view, prompt engineering is likely a temporary solution, one we expect the industry to shift away from as LLMs improve in terms of task comprehension and context window size (though the timeline for this shift remains uncertain). Meanwhile, existing businesses in this domain have a chance to pivot their business model, leveraging their current distribution to tap into emerging opportunities.

B) Human-In-The-Loop

Definition: Human-In-The-Loop Critique refers to the use of humans to validate that Agents are accurately processing and reasoning through tasks.

Human-In-The-Loop Critique is just what it sounds like: leveraging humans to correct or modify the reasoning of LLMs. Currently, developers use this method when building Agents, as they want visibility into their inner workings. Because it requires that people scale linearly with compute resources, it will likely be unsustainable in the long term.

C) Auto-Critique

Definition: Auto-Critique refers to the autonomous use of LLMs to check and modify Agent reasoning about a task.

Humans often make decisions in multiple steps: starting with an initial judgement, then assessing its consequences, and evaluating alternatives. Throughout this process, we add new information, remember past experiences, and take note of what others have done. We call this “thinking it through,” and LLMs perform a similar process when refining their own outputs. Like the brain, they begin with a rough first pass – a digital gut instinct, one might say – before iterating to either expand on that conclusion or critique it.

Auto-Critique is an autonomous process that allows Agents to improve and amend their own output by reflecting on past responses and errors, all without human intervention. To do this, Agents draw on new input from a variety of sources, including external Tools, other Agents, affiliated LLMs, and heuristic functions. Once they arrive at a sufficient result (governed by predefined metrics for evaluating self-reasoning), a stop condition is granted, allowing Agents to finalize their output.

Teaming: The Rise of the Planet of the Multi-Agent Systems

So far, we’ve focused largely on the mechanisms and potential of standalone Agents. However, to fully appreciate the potential of this nascent sector, we must also look at the collective strength of Agent Teaming, otherwise known as Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Within the framework of a MAS, the power of individual Agents is not merely aggregated – it’s amplified, boosting the overall effectiveness of the system in a multiplicative and potentially exponential manner.

Returning once again to our Agent Analyst example, we must remember that building market maps is but one of many tasks of an Activant analyst. In fact, a market map is only a small piece of the larger research and investment process – analysts must also deal with financials, retention, defensibility, and much more. In their current state, no one Agent could write a complete investment memo, though individual Agents could accomplish each component. This is the promise of Multi-Agent Systems: they’re able to accomplish significantly more complex tasks than single Agents ever could.

Definition: A MAS is a network of intelligent Agents that interact with each other, forming a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication network.

Early attempts at the concept (i.e., March 2023), such as Agent-Based Systems (ABS), were inherently limited. In an ABS, though multiple Agents work on the same task, they can’t collaborate. They’re also forced to work within narrow, predefined constraints. The result? Rather than act autonomously, Agents are confined to rudimentary roles with very strict and cyclical operating patterns. Think of BabyAGI’s cycle of operation: Agents follow relatively one-dimensional orders, are only sequentially prompted, and report back to their "commanding" Agent when given a task is complete. As one can imagine, given the limited scope and flexibility, such systems have been less than transformative.9

By contrast, a MAS encourages direct communication between two or more Agents – with minimal rules governing how they operate. This supercharges the system, leveraging Agents’ collective cognition and problem-solving capabilities to solve complex problems quickly, reliably, and effectively. As systems shift away from rigid and sequential orders to more dynamic, human-like interaction, their ability to tackle such problems will only increase.

Below, we further examine the concept of Multi-Agent Systems, highlighting their novel and significant advantages.

The Value of Multi-Agent Systems

Quantifying the value-add of Multi-Agent Systems is a considerable challenge. The nuances of their applications – and the myriad ways they can be designed and built – mean the perceived benefits can vary widely. That said, there are distinct, universally applicable advantages that are evident even now, despite the infancy of the space.

Distributed Intelligence

MASs address a key shortcoming of ABSs, wherein the executing Agent in an ABS might become overwhelmed and falter when confronted with an exceedingly complex task. In an ABS, the first executing Agent is responsible for the detailed planning and implementation of extensive, high-level goals given by the “planning” Agent – a load that can cause the system to buckle. A MAS instead breaks down tasks across multiple Agents recursively, making them far more resilient. 
 
In theory, you could envision an Agent structure that decomposes workflows and tasks into the smallest unit possible: a “task quantum.” A multitude of Agents could then be tasked with handling a singular piece of the overall problem. By divvying up tasks in this way, it’s possible for the system to tackle incredibly complex challenges, simply by having each Agent follow a clear, simple set of instructions.

Imagine an architect who designs a grand monument. While the architect can create the blueprint, they almost certainly lack the skills (and the time) to physically construct their vision. Instead, they delegate smaller tasks to teams of workers, who are managed by others experienced in construction tasks. Just as the architect relies on numerous teams to execute their blueprint, a MAS distributes tasks to many Agents to achieve complex goals. Each Agent, the equivalent of a bricklayer in our analogy, might not be able to plan and execute the entire task, but can perform its piece of the task – its task quantum – efficiently and effectively. This accumulation of simple tasks, handled by numerous Agents, ultimately accomplishes the overarching objective.

Scalability

As the complexity of a problem escalates, more individual Agents can be integrated into the system, rather than whole new Agent-based systems being added. Scalability also relates to the distributed nature of MASs, where tasks and decision-making processes are spread across multiple Agents. This distribution allows the system to handle larger and more complex tasks – without requiring a necessarily proportional increase in computational resources.

Parallelism

The power of MASs isn’t just in distributing tasks. They also benefit from enabling Agents to communicate directly, allowing them to optimize their own workflows.

For example, as Agents work together on tasks, they share information on their successes or failures – creating a “knowledge network” that helps Agents refine their efforts. If one Agent encounters a setback, it alerts the others, enabling the collective to bypass strategies that have already proven ineffective and preventing duplicate failures.
 
Conversely, if an Agent finds a successful approach, it shares the insight with the rest, allowing them to focus on and expand this productive pathway. In essence, the Agents are continuously learning from each other's experiences, coalescing around promising or unexplored avenues of action. Through this exchange, groups of Agents can more efficiently navigate tasks, minimizing failures and maximizing productivity.

Decentralization

Decentralization is one of the key advantages of Multi-Agent Systems. While Agents in an ABS may be bound by centralized rules and workflows, MASs, by contrast, ensure Agents can survive independently from one another. Unlike in an ABS – where a single breakdown can cascade into a system-wide disruption – if an Agent fails in a MAS, the network will remain intact, simply reassigning that Agent’s tasks.

Final Thoughts

As Agents take over these and many other aspects of our work, we see our roles transforming in exciting ways: instead of constructing market maps, we’ll evaluate them; instead of building models, we’ll test their assumptions; instead of writing memos, we’ll discuss their implications. In our work, and in most fields, experience earned over years of apprenticeship won’t be replaced, and human-to-human interaction will continue to be the most important driver of value.

At Activant, we are passionate about the Agent Ecosystem, and this work is only a subset of our research to date. For each of the components we discussed, there are additional considerations and frameworks when applying them to Multi-Agent Systems – everything from the use of Tools across multiple Agents at once to concurrency issues in shared working memory. Additionally, in developing enterprise-ready applications, a few more components are required, such as Agent Security, Compliance Management, Access Provisioning, and Agent Profile Management. On top of all that, we’ve begun diving into how Agents will be built in verticals like fintech, cybersecurity, commerce, and logistics.

If you’re building in this space, thinking about how to approach using Agents in your organization or just looking to ideate – let’s talk.

Endnotes

[1] Ironically, the brick layer will be among the last to be automated. The most automatable tasks are those that have the smallest action space, and while laying bricks may seem relatively simple compared to working in Excel, the reality is a 2-dimensional Excel Workbook has significantly fewer possible actions than a 3-dimensional job site exposed to the elements.

However, despite the high potential, there were major obstacles to developing and deploying autonomous AI systems, such as safety concerns, regulatory barriers, and the requirement for reliable testing and validation.\n\nComponent Insights\n\nThe software segment led the market with a revenue share of over 42.0% in 2022. The market for software is growing rapidly due to the systems evolving over time, adapting to their environment, and learning from it. An autonomous agent is a piece of software or a program that can do things or make decisions for a user or a system without the need for human intervention. Autonomous agents are designed to accomplish specific tasks or goals while interacting with the environment or other autonomous agents. For instance,\xa0Chatbots\xa0are self-serve agents that can communicate with users via text or voice, respond to queries, provide data, and even complete tasks such as scheduling appointments or ordering products. For another instance, in March 2023, Adept, a U.S.-based software company, raised USD 350 million to build a digital assistant, which is an AI model that is able to transform a text command into sets of actions.\n\nThe service segment is predicted to witness significant growth in the forecast years. Consulting services are in demand due to increased requirements for expert guidance and strategic advice. The consultants worked with businesses to develop a roadmap for implementing autonomous AI and agents, identifying use cases, defining project objectives, assessing the suitability of existing technologies or platforms for autonomous AI integration, developing data strategy for collecting, storing, and managing data for training and operating autonomous agents, changing workflows and employee roles for the implementation of autonomous systems, improving and optimizing the performance of autonomous agents and AI systems, and advising on ethical considerations and compliance with regulations, especially in sectors with strict guidelines.\n\nTechnology Insights\n\nThe\xa0machine learning\xa0segment led the market with a revenue share of over 35.0% in 2022. Several factors drive this growth in machine learning technology because an autonomous agent is a software program that perceives its environment, makes decisions based on that perception, and acts accordingly. Autonomous agents are typically implemented using machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning. Agents receive information from their environment, such as sensor data, camera images, sensor readings, & others, and then process the input data using machine learning algorithms and make decisions based on the current state and its goals. For example, using reinforcement learning, the autonomous agent learns how to take action that maximizes a cumulative reward.\n\nThe\xa0computer vision\xa0segment is expected to witness significant growth in the coming years. The factors propelling the technology market growth include autonomous agent’s computer vision technology enabled that are able to interact with their environment and make decisions based on visual data. They can be used in robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other autonomous systems. The concept of autonomous agents is based on perception, where the agent perceives its environment through the use of computer vision. This can include tasks such as tracking objects, avoiding obstacles, or recognizing landmarks. The agent can then reason and decide about its actions based on the visual data. For instance, a robot with computer vision may be able to detect an object in its field of vision and decide to pick it up. Machine learning can also help autonomous agents improve their performance by allowing them to learn new objects, adjust to different lighting, and fine-tune their decision-making processes.\n\nEnd-use Industry Insights\n\nThe BFSI segment led the market with a revenue share of 21.0% in 2022.The terms autonomous AI and autonomous agents are used to describe the use of cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and automation (automation) technologies in the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) industry.

Market Dynamics
Driver: Increasing AI Applications as a Catalyst for Autonomous AI and Agents

One significant driver for the rise of autonomous AI and agents is the increasing number of AI applications across diverse domains. From healthcare and finance to transportation and manufacturing, AI is being employed to solve complex problems and optimize processes. These applications leverage advanced algorithms, machine learning, and data analysis techniques to extract valuable insights and automate decision-making. As the demand for efficient and intelligent solutions grows, so does the need for autonomous AI systems and agents that can adapt and operate independently without constant human intervention.

Restraint: Limited Adaptability and Contextual Understanding in Autonomous AI and Agents

Limited adaptability and contextual understanding are significant restraints that impede the effectiveness of autonomous AI and agents in various domains. These restraints arise from the complexity of human interactions and the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios. While AI systems may excel at specific tasks within predefined parameters, they often struggle to adapt to unfamiliar situations or handle unpredictable environments. Contextual understanding, which involves interpreting and responding appropriately to diverse cues and environmental factors, presents a challenging task for AI algorithms.

How Autonomous AI Agents are Reshaping Industries and Redefining Expertise
Jonathan Carroll-Madden  September 21, 2023

AI technologies have fundamentally changed the way we live our daily lives, due in no small part to the rapid expansion of their use across all industries. In just 2015, the phrase “self-driving car” invoked futuristic, Jetson-like images in our minds. Today, it’s a reality. Products like Tesla's Autopilot or Waymo’s driverless taxis have initiated a surge in employing sophisticated algorithms to navigate busy streets with minimal degrees of human intervention. Similarly, robotic vacuum cleaners like Roomba have become household names, bringing intelligent automation into our living rooms and freeing up time previously devoted to monotonous household chores. In each of these scenarios, AI systems are showcasing their potential to learn and adapt, reducing the need for human oversight and bringing efficiency to tasks ranging from the mundane to the highly complex. At the cutting-edge of this revolution is Google's DeepMind, which has demonstrated a stunning aptitude for mastering intricate games like Go—a board game with more possible moves than there are atoms in the universe.


Moving beyond just entertainment and daily conveniences, AI technologies are steadily making inroads into professional domains and promising to redefine expertise. To understand this trend, take GitHub's Copilot, an AI-powered code completion assistant. This tool has the potential to overhaul previous methods of software development by automating huge chunks of the coding process. Through its analysis of vast repositories of data (and its contextually-based code suggestions) Copilot stands as a testament to the enormous strides AI has taken towards facilitating innovation--and, arguably, steering us closer to a future in which autonomous agents are not just tools, but active collaborators in the creative process. In this article, we’ll explore the monumental advancements of autonomous AI agents and delve into their real-world applications, which have the power to transform industries and reshape the long-held norms of business operations. We also will shed light on how the integration of AI in tools in business is spearheading a movement towards complete autonomy, and the application of AI for increasingly creative measures.

Understanding Autonomous AI Agents

When assessing the value of software, one key measure lies in automation; making processes swifter and more scalable. As we’re ushered into an era that’s characterized by massive data flows and instant processing, the multitasking abilities of these bots have become indispensable. These aren’t just tools; they signify a seismic shift in our expectations surrounding AI and how we interact with technology.

What makes these bots unique? Adaptability. They’re able to adjust and evolve to match the environments they’re in, and to face whatever challenge is at hand. From navigating new tasks to swift decision making, their ability to process mass amounts of data and discern patterns allows these agents to derive new insights and act with the relevance required to be an effective tool in today’s world. According to Yann LeCun, pioneer in deep learning and long-time ML engineer, 

“Our intelligence is what makes us human, and AI is an extension of that quality.”

These sophisticated decision-making abilities are fueled by the massive volumes of information they process, allowing these agents to identify relevant patterns, extract meaningful insights, and generate contextually appropriate responses that are beyond simple rule-based approaches. This enables the AI agents to evaluate complex trade-offs and prioritize actions in pursuit of defined goals.

To truly appreciate this evolution, we have to juxtapose automation and autonomy. Think of today’s AI models like ChatGPT which, while very intelligent, still fall back on human input to guide and manipulate them. Imagine AI agents as autonomous as the self-driving cars we envisioned in 2015. We’re on the cusp of a paradigm shift from partial to full autonomy, ushering in a future with AI sidekicks capable of independent operations–without regular or even frequent human check-ins.

Use Cases

The advent of GPT-4 (and other highly advanced instructional models) has ushered a new wave of innovation. It’s unleashing a whole host of applications where autonomous AI agents can truly shine. These agents have shown an aptitude for incorporating large data sets and transforming them into valuable insights based on large-scale pattern recognition. This shift is empowering organizations to navigate their path to success with unprecedented confidence, and elevating user experiences along the way.

Beyond diagnostics, where AI has already demonstrated its prowess in detecting conditions from medical imaging alone, the post-GPT-3.5 era is moving towards more proactive care. AI agents are now able to predict potential health crises by analyzing patient data over time, thereby preempting issues before they can become critical. This isn't simply about better diagnostics; it’s about revolutionizing healthcare by moving from a reactive to a proactive approach, lowering long-term medical costs and improving public health as best we can.  

2. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND ETHICAL INVESTMENTS:

The financial sector’s consistently been a hotbed for tech and AI innovations the last few years, particularly when it comes to high-frequency trading.  AI capabilities are able to tackle problems such as risk assessment faster, and more accurately, than their human counterparts. Rather than merely relying on historical data of stock performance, these agents now factor in geopolitical events, emerging market trends, and societal shifts among other variables. Cutting-edge AI algorithms can scan markets, recognize trends, and make swift trading decisions. AI is creating a new kind of intelligence; reshaping industries and empowering organizations to make better predictions faster, driving better outcomes and gaining a competitive edge in their respective industries. Furthermore, with the recent rise in ethical investing, autonomous AI agents make it much easier to sift through corporate data and gauge a company’s environmental or social impact, while fine tuning its choices to better align with your social and political stances, particularly when it comes to making ethical investment decisions.

3. BRIDGING THE ONLINE/OFFLINE RETAIL EXPERIENCE:

While personalization has been the long-held cornerstone of online retail success for companies like Amazon, our physical shopping experience has largely remained the same. However, with the use of AI and augmented reality, we can merge the customizability of the online retail experience with the tactile satisfaction of shopping. Imagine walking into a store where AI, though augmented reality interfaces, are able to  provide product recommendations based on your online history. By integrating the personalized touch of the digital age into traditional shopping, AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we do the mundane.  

Benefits, Opportunities, & Potential Drawbacks

Autonomous AI can work without rest, tackling repetitive tasks like data entry and analysis with unfailing precision. Through the augmentation of AI and human agents, efficiency, productivity, and scalability can be improved with minimal costs. Exemplifying this are AI chatbots, who are able to provide rapid customer service, regardless of the time of day, at the customer’s convenience. Further, the almost overnight improvements of large language models has enabled chatbots to understand and generate human-like natural language, enabling more effective customer service platforms.  

Conversational AI agents, such as ChatGPT and Bing Chat,  can provide a seamless user experience by understanding and responding to user queries. These agents can offer personalized recommendations and resolutions, not only enhancing customer satisfaction, but driving engagement.  With an analysis of past preferences or shopping trends, AI agents suggest products and tackle your calendar  as if they've known you for ages. Beyond shopping, these digital aids streamline tasks from setting up a lunch date to reminding you of your next big presentation.

That being said, while autonomous AI agents have indeed brought about remarkable advancements in various spheres of our daily lives and industries, it’s also essential to acknowledge the boundaries of these technologies.

The Pew Research Center reminds us, "AI merely ‘models’ human activity. No amount of improvement in the development of these models turns the ‘model’ into the ‘thing.’ Human beings remain the source of all intent and the judge of all outcomes." 

This statement reminds us that despite the significant strides AI technologies have taken, they remain tools. These tools must be presided over by human intent and expertise, which emphasizes the indispensable role of human oversight in leveraging AI's potential both responsibly and effectively. 

Conclusion

Autonomous AI agents represent a significant milestone in the advancement of artificial intelligence. Using AI to automate tasks that normally would require a human will enable new levels of efficiency, productivity, and scalability, revolutionizing the way in which we can interact with technology. The integration of AI agents in various applications has already demonstrated their significant value–from AI-powered chatbots providing round-the-clock customer support, to trading algorithms optimizing investment strategies in the financial industry, these agents have proven their ability to drive better outcomes and deliver a competitive advantage in a diverse array of sectors. In the coming years, the continuous evolution of autonomous AI agents has the potential to shape a future that combines the ingenuity of human creativity with the efficiency and intelligence of technology.

With every wave of innovation comes a chorus of such pronouncements, many of which turn out to be hyperbole. Technology may make our jobs easier, but most of the time, the core of what we do remains fundamentally the same. But spend five minutes on ChatGPT, or any comparable Large Language Model (LLM), and it’s clear: it’s different.\n\nThe reason is simple. Most technologies help us accomplish tasks. They’re tools, a means of making us more productive. AI, on the other hand, can think (or at least, provide the appearance of thinking). It’s like having another knowledge worker on the payroll.\n\nActivant Perspective 1: LLM-enabled software will autonomously accomplish highly complex tasks.\n\nThis is the beauty (and threat) of LLMs: they can do work we thought would long be the purview of humans.\n\nGiven this, one could be forgiven for worrying their job will soon be automated away by an AI. In the short term, this will lead to dislocation. But technological revolutions are never zero-sum – in fact, they’ve always been accretive. As workers adapt, they become more productive, and the companies they work for can do more with less. Some stop there, to be sure, but most businesses opt to invest the gains back into their infrastructure and people. In the end, revenues go up, and the economy grows.\n\nThat said, we’re still in the very first days of this cycle – and critically, of the technology itself.\n\nActivant Perspective 2: LLMs alone are not enough to achieve Perspective 1.\n\nCase in point: a large language model can’t complete most tasks on its own. After all, an LLM is merely a dense set of attention networks; essentially, statistics on a massive scale. Yes, they can engage in human-like “thought,” but to generate real value from any of these models, a human would have to integrate them into actual workflows – and make use of their decision-making prowess.\n\nFor example, imagine that you hired someone to lay bricks. You could lead them to a stack of bricks and explain where and how you want them laid. They could perfectly understand your instructions. Yet, understanding isn’t enough – the worker needs to be able to, well, lay bricks.\n\nIn this case, they need to have more than just cognition – they need to have arms, legs, and physical strength. Furthermore, they need a memory to recall how you wanted each of the bricks to be arranged, and a way of correcting any errors so they don’t cause the eventual structure to fail.1\n\nPut another way, if LLMs are to extend beyond mere Q&A, they need (1) a suite of Tools to actually impact the real world, (2) memory repositories to remember what actions they’ve taken, and (3) auto-critique algorithms to error correct along the way.\n\nWhen all these components come together, an “Agent” is born.\n\nTechnical Definition: An Agent is orchestration software that combines an LLM with memory, tools, and auto-critique algorithms.\n\nNon-Technical Definition: An Agent is a highly advanced bot that can complete work that has been assigned to it in natural language.\n\nThough still in their infancy, Agents are poised to fundamentally reshape the way we work. They will become natural extensions of your organization and complete day-to-day tasks – akin to hiring more employees. They’ll help you get work done, even collaborate with others on your behalf. Eventually, they’ll be able to work together, breaking down tasks into atoms of work able to be handled by a full “office” of Agents, some of which orchestrate, while others specialize.\n\nThe result is why this time is different: working together, Agents will be able to handle increasingly complex tasks, replacing knowledge workers in a variety of fields. As they do, what it means to work – and to lead – will change drastically, as both will increasingly depend on a mix of human and human-like capital.\n\nActivant Perspective 3: Agent Teaming is the future of autonomously completed, complex work – and that future is possible today.\n\nFew have sketched a path from where we are today, to the autonomous knowledge workers of the future. But that future is closer than you’d think, and one for which you almost certainly want a roadmap. To learn more about how this transformation will unfold, and how you can best position yourself within it, read on.\n\nResearch\nThe Agent Ecosystem 2\n\nThe Agent Ecosystem of the future has four key components:\n\nLLMs (Large Language Models): provide “conscious thought” within AI Agents and have been trained on text data,\nTools: external APIs to facilitate task completion and Agent interaction with the real world,\nMemory: includes various data storage mechanisms to retain and recall information, and\nSelf-Critique: the ability to correct mistakes when completing tasks.\n\nTo better understand the components, we imagine how each one might erode a job we know quite well: that of an analyst at Activant (sorry, John). Among many other things, we often rely on our analysts to create market maps, which requires them to:\n\nUnderstand an industry,\nFind companies that exist in that industry,\nCompare these companies qualitatively, and\nPlace them on a 2-dimensional grid according to this comparison.\n\nUntil recently, this was almost inconceivable as a task for machines. Now, let’s explore how we’d put our “Agent Analyst” to use.\n\nThesis Map\nAI Agent Ecosystem\n1. Understanding the Industry (and the Task) – Large Language Models\n\nFor our Agent Analyst to understand the task at hand, it requires the capacity to comprehend instructions stated in natural language. While LLMs provide that ability, they come in many different shapes and sizes (literally). For that reason, here we outline a basic framework for evaluating LLM providers, including both foundational model providers and companies offering Fine-Tuning as-a-Service (FTaaS3).\n\nWhen comparing foundational models, the number of parameters in a model is often a good approximation of output quality. As a rule of thumb, the more parameters a foundational model has, the better its performance across different benchmarks, such as reasoning, web browsing, or even game playing. Although fine-tuning a model can boost its performance on a particular task, larger models with more parameters tend to have better generalization skills – making them more useful.\n\nAs seen below, model sizes are increasing on an exponential basis with base 2, and although not pictured, model performance is similarly increasing – just not at the same rate.\n\nResearch\nFoundational Models Size Map\nOpen vs. Closed Source LLMs\n\nAt the heart of any LLM lies its architecture: a blueprint dictating how various attention heads and layers are organized. Then, there are the "weights" — numeric values assigned to parameters in the neural network, refined and adjusted through training to enhance performance. Training involves feeding data into the model, allowing it to learn and make predictions, and then adjusting the weights based on its accuracy. It\'s through this process, often requiring substantial computational resources, that the model obtains its ability to understand and generate human-like text.\n\nOpen-source models, such as Llama 2 by Meta, “openly” share their architecture, weights, and sometimes even their training methodologies. This approach not only reveals the intricacies of their design but also democratizes access, allowing enterprises, researchers, and even enthusiasts to build upon, refine, or entirely repurpose these models for their own applications.\n\nConversely, some entities opt for a more guarded approach. Closed-source models, such as GPT-4 by OpenAI, often protect the details of their architecture, weights, or training processes, presenting them as somewhat of a black box. Instead of allowing direct model access, they employ APIs as intermediaries, thereby controlling and often monetizing the interaction between the end user and the model.\n\nMarket Map\nFoundational Models\nProvider Modality\n\n“Provider Modality” relates to the data type a provider offers models for. This includes various transformations such as text-to-video, text-to-text, text-to-image, and image-to-text, among others. Companies that operate in just one domain are labeled as “Uni-Modal”; by contrast, “Multi-Modal” companies provide models spanning multiple domains. As Agents continue to evolve, we expect a growing emphasis on modality in LLM models, as those able to perform more diverse tasks and offer easier integrations will have a distinct advantage in the marketplace.\n\nWhile Agents will no doubt depend on the Today, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic dominate the industry, but this is hardly set in stone. If anything, the next few years will see considerable competition, with whoever invests the most in R&D in a constant arms race. Given this uncertainty – and the promise of better models always around the bend – it’s hard to imagine Agents relying on a single provider. From an investment perspective, backing one LLM provider is essentially a vote of confidence in its R&D team, but past performance is not (necessarily) indicative of future results.\n\n2. Finding Companies – Tools\n\nHaving understood the industry (and the task), the Agent Analyst now needs the ability to search for companies. In other words, the Agent Analyst needs a Tool.\n\nDefinition: Tools are snippets of code that foundational models can use to create, modify, and utilize external resources in order to execute tasks they couldn’t otherwise complete on their own.\n\nMost Tools are problem specific. In this case, all the Agent Analyst needs is a connection to Google, or SerpAPI, a prominent wrapper for Google’s Search API. Unsurprisingly, other tasks will require different Tools. Game this out, and you quickly arrive at the need for Toolkits and Tool Aggregators. As tasks become more complex, Agents will rely on not one, but a variety of Tools to accomplish a single objective. Through Aggregators, Agents will be able to access the resources they need, programmatically, and as those needs arise.\n\nMarket Map\nAI & LLM Tooling Companies\n\n*More companies are launched every day- if we missed you...please reach out!\n\nSingle Tools\n\nSingle Tools refer to companies or services that specialize in just one function, such as searching the internet, booking a flight, or creating realistic voice audio files. While these offerings do have certain strengths, integrating them into a Toolbox, and thus into Agents, is often cumbersome. Notably, in prominent Agent libraries4 like LangChain, Toolboxes need to be set up before an Agent itself is even initialized. This means if there\'s a need to integrate additional Tools later – for example, if an Agent encounters a new task that requires a Tool outside of its preset toolkit – the Agent would have to initialized all over again. Given these considerations, embedding Single Tools into an Agent\'s workflow can be quite labor-intensive and time-consuming.\n\nMarket Map\nAI Agent Tooling\nTool Aggregators\n\nBy contrast, Tool Aggregators offer Toolboxes-as-a-Service (TaaS). Theoretically, aggregators can compile an infinite number of Tools and distribute them via a single, unified API. In practice, they typically provide Tools that have been identified by an Agent as required to complete a given task. If an Agent requires determines it needs additional tools, however, it can access them without restarting.\n\nLow-Code / No-Code (LCNC)\n\nA subset of Tool aggregators, LCNC companies could provision Tools and/or provide tool-building functionality for Agents. As long as they offer an API, Agents can leverage these solutions as they do Tool Aggregators, integrating (and even custom-building) Tools into their workflows on the fly.\n\nAutomation\n\nWhy Using Internal Tools to do More with Less Matters Today\nRead the Deep Dive\n\nMany LCNC platforms have existed prior to the advent of LLMs and already have large libraries of powerful, ready-built Tools to draw upon. Several companies, including Relevance AI and Superblocks, have begun offering Agents-as-a-Service (AaaS), using these libraries to jump ahead of competitors, many of which are starting from scratch. Others may choose to offer APIs to facilitate quick adoption within the Agent Ecosystem and more reliably maintain their market share.\n\nBecause of their ease of integration and use, we believe Tool Aggregators and API-based LCNC platforms are the best positioned to take advantage of this new Agent ecosystem. As platforms like LlamaIndex and Relevance AI grow, Agents will be able to dynamically access a vast library of toolsets without needing to update their structure or code – increasing both their functionality and value.\n\n3. Comparing Companies – Memory\n\nAs our Agent Analyst has progressed, it has gained the capability to discern tasks and search for companies. However, identifying a company means nothing if an Agent can’t remember it for later use. To facilitate this, Agents require a dedicated memory component that can store companies and their associated descriptions.\n\nMarket Map\nMemory\n\nOver the years, the software industry has seen a multitude of data-structure innovations, from traditional SQL-based relational tables to modern streaming services like Kafka. Yet, to truly grasp the intricacies of Agent development and the depth of virtual cognition, it\'s helpful to draw parallels with human memory.\n\nAt a high level, human memory is split into three core categories: sensory memory, short-term (or working) memory, and long-term memory.\n\nSensory Memory\n\nIn humans, sensory memory can be thought of as the direct inputs from our various senses — taste, smell, sight, touch, and hearing. These are perceived subconsciously, processed then filtered for relevance. Similarly, in the realm of Agents, sensory memory captures the responses generated from the Tools they employ. Research in neuroscience and psychology reveals that of the countless sensory inputs humans encounter every moment, only about 5% ascends to conscious awareness, courtesy of various attention mechanisms. Our neural framework efficiently filters out redundant and useless sensory data, elevating only important information for conscious processing. The sensory memory of an Agent operates on similar principles, sieving through vast data while retaining only what\'s significant.\n\nFor example, to store the names and descriptions of any relevant companies it finds, our Agent Analyst might choose to create a vector database. To do that, the Agent could use the Pinecone API and receive a specifically formatted JSON response directly. Though the Agent could use the LLM to parse that JSON response, it would be far more efficient for the Agent to use the Pinecone Tool from Llama Hub and receive a pre-processed Python dict. In many ways, this is analogous to how our subconscious mind pre-processes data before it needs to be consciously thought about – i.e. you don’t have to process the shoe touching your foot when you’re using your finger to touch your phone because your subconscious brain filters the shoe sensation out.\n\nOver time, we believe that sensory memory will include the ingestion of many different data types, from unstructured data files (such as docx, pdf, epub, or recordings) to semi-structured datasets (such as messages and CRM data). As of today, it is unclear to us if “sensory” processing should or could be handled at the Tool level, like it is in the above Pinecone example, because we don’t know if Tool Aggregators will provide a standardized API for these tools – or if it’s even possible to have a standardized API across all conceivable Tools. What we do believe as a result of our work is that the quality of Agent-handled sensory memory will be highly correlated with the quality of the Agent itself.\n\nShort-Term Memory\n\nHaving processed inputs on the subconscious level, Agents are left with the inputs which require conscious thought. In humans, conscious thoughts reside in working or short-term memory. When we actively think about a topic, we do not consciously remember the context for the thought in our “memory,” but it is nevertheless remembered. In fact, our short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about seven items5 and lasts for 20-30 seconds. For Agents, using the context windows defined by LLMs to store short-term memory is the default solution of most Agents we see today, and we don’t see that changing. As context windows increase in length and new techniques for prompt engineering solve existing constraints, the context window will be an even more effective location for short-term memory.\n\nInterestingly, most short-term memory will be forgotten after a certain time threshold, especially after corresponding actions are finished. Though some of this information may be transitioned into long-term memory (which we discuss below), most of an Agent’s short-term memory will not be useful after a task is completed. Therefore, short-term memory data can be stored in the context and does not require the same complex storage techniques long-term memory does.\n\nIn the context of our Agent Analyst, short-term memory can be thought of as remembering the larger task at hand (i.e., creating a market map) when deciding what smaller task (i.e., finding a company) needs to be accomplished next. In practice, this information will largely live inside the context window of the LLM API call – and while it’s essential for the Agent to complete a task, we believe that there is little opportunity for investment in short-term memory due to the limited additional infrastructure required to build it.\n\nLong-Term Memory\n\nOnce subconscious and conscious memory is in place, an Agent Analyst will need some way of saving information for longer periods than the immediate task at hand. This is where long-term memory comes into play.\n\nIn humans, long-term memory is finite, due to the limited capacity of the brain. As a result, we have developed two primary mechanisms to retain knowledge: repetition and adrenaline. For obvious reasons (i.e., they can use ACID databases), Agents lack this capacity constraint. Instead, they are limited by the amount of memory that they could conceivably “know” how to access. For example, if our Agent Analyst was integrated into our Drive and needed to search for the PowerPoint example of our Market Map, the size of the context window would limit the number of folders that it could select from in its search.\n\nIn our view, connections to long-term memory repositories are no different than Tools, in that they are blocks of code that can be executed and return a response.\n\nOver the next decade, we believe that the entire ecosystem of data management will grow even faster than it has historically because of increased Agent data utilization. Agents will be able to build pipelines from company data, leverage it in their own processes, and integrate outside data into existing workflows. The total spend on databases and database management solutions doubled from $38.6B in 2017 to $80B in 20216. As the Agent ecosystem grows, the demand for data stores will increase even more rapidly, making the volumes of unstructured company data – which today sits untouched – significantly more valuable.\n\nWe’ve listed a handful of data structures, and the impact we anticipate from Agents, below:\n\nResearch\nAI Agent Use Case w/r/t Databases\n4. Placing Company Logos – Auto-Critique\n\nOur Agent Analyst has successfully understood the industry, used a search Tool to find all the companies within it, and saved them in a database for future output. As a final step, we need the Agent to place the logos of each of those companies onto an Activant Market Map – fully understanding the significance of each company’s position. Naturally, this will involve a Tool that enables the Agent to create graphs. In the short term, this Tool will likely be some wrapper around Our Agent Analyst has successfully understood the industry, used a search Tool to find all the companies within it, and saved them in a database for future output. As a final step, we need the Agent to place the logos of each of those companies onto an Activant Market Map – fully understanding the significance of each company’s position. Naturally, this will involve a Tool that enables the Agent to create graphs. In the short term, this Tool will likely be some wrapper around Matplotlib7 but in the long term, this will undoubtedly be an integration into PowerPoint.\n\nPlotting logos, of course, is the easy part of the challenge; understanding where to place a logo in a subjective 2-dimensional plane is the truly complex task. It requires iterations, constant comparisons to other companies, and perhaps even outside input from the Activant team. Therefore, the Agent needs a mechanism for critiquing itself. We call this Auto-Critique.\n\nWhile we foresee potential challenges - like defensibility - this remains a vital component of the ecosystem with several approaches underway: (A) Prompt Engineering, (B) Human-In-The-Loop, and (C) Auto-Critique.\n\nMarket Map\nSelf-Critique\nA) Prompt Engineering\n\nDefinition: Prompt Engineering is the process of forming and refining natural language statements and questions to achieve an optimal outcome from an LLM.\n\nIn practice, LLMs are only capable of comprehending and responding to inputs that fit within a defined context window. For example, GPT4’s context window is about eight thousand tokens – meaning only about seven thousand words can be provided as context at any one time.8 In order to maximize the utility of the model, a prompt engineer could write shorter and more effective prompts.\n\nIn our view, prompt engineering is likely a temporary solution, one we expect the industry to shift away from as LLMs improve in terms of task comprehension and context window size (though the timeline for this shift remains uncertain). Meanwhile, existing businesses in this domain have a chance to pivot their business model, leveraging their current distribution to tap into emerging opportunities.\n\nB) Human-In-The-Loop\n\nDefinition: Human-In-The-Loop Critique refers to the use of humans to validate that Agents are accurately processing and reasoning through tasks.\n\nHuman-In-The-Loop Critique is just what it sounds like: leveraging humans to correct or modify the reasoning of LLMs. Currently, developers use this method when building Agents, as they want visibility into their inner workings. Because it requires that people scale linearly with compute resources, it will likely be unsustainable in the long term.\n\nC) Auto-Critique\n\nDefinition: Auto-Critique refers to the autonomous use of LLMs to check and modify Agent reasoning about a task.\n\nHumans often make decisions in multiple steps: starting with an initial judgement, then assessing its consequences, and evaluating alternatives. Throughout this process, we add new information, remember past experiences, and take note of what others have done. We call this “thinking it through,” and LLMs perform a similar process when refining their own outputs. Like the brain, they begin with a rough first pass – a digital gut instinct, one might say – before iterating to either expand on that conclusion or critique it.\n\nAuto-Critique is an autonomous process that allows Agents to improve and amend their own output by reflecting on past responses and errors, all without human intervention. To do this, Agents draw on new input from a variety of sources, including external Tools, other Agents, affiliated LLMs, and heuristic functions. Once they arrive at a sufficient result (governed by predefined metrics for evaluating self-reasoning), a stop condition is granted, allowing Agents to finalize their output.\n\nTeaming: The Rise of the Planet of the Multi-Agent Systems\n\nSo far, we’ve focused largely on the mechanisms and potential of standalone Agents. However, to fully appreciate the potential of this nascent sector, we must also look at the collective strength of Agent Teaming, otherwise known as Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Within the framework of a MAS, the power of individual Agents is not merely aggregated – it’s amplified, boosting the overall effectiveness of the system in a multiplicative and potentially exponential manner.\n\nReturning once again to our Agent Analyst example, we must remember that building market maps is but one of many tasks of an Activant analyst. In fact, a market map is only a small piece of the larger research and investment process – analysts must also deal with financials, retention, defensibility, and much more. In their current state, no one Agent could write a complete investment memo, though individual Agents could accomplish each component. This is the promise of Multi-Agent Systems: they’re able to accomplish significantly more complex tasks than single Agents ever could.\n\nDefinition: A MAS is a network of intelligent Agents that interact with each other, forming a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication network.\n\nEarly attempts at the concept (i.e., March 2023), such as Agent-Based Systems (ABS), were inherently limited. In an ABS, though multiple Agents work on the same task, they can’t collaborate. They’re also forced to work within narrow, predefined constraints. The result? Rather than act autonomously, Agents are confined to rudimentary roles with very strict and cyclical operating patterns. Think of BabyAGI’s cycle of operation: Agents follow relatively one-dimensional orders, are only sequentially prompted, and report back to their "commanding" Agent when given a task is complete. As one can imagine, given the limited scope and flexibility, such systems have been less than transformative.9\n\nBy contrast, a MAS encourages direct communication between two or more Agents – with minimal rules governing how they operate. This supercharges the system, leveraging Agents’ collective cognition and problem-solving capabilities to solve complex problems quickly, reliably, and effectively. As systems shift away from rigid and sequential orders to more dynamic, human-like interaction, their ability to tackle such problems will only increase.\n\nBelow, we further examine the concept of Multi-Agent Systems, highlighting their novel and significant advantages.\n\nThe Value of Multi-Agent Systems\n\nQuantifying the value-add of Multi-Agent Systems is a considerable challenge. The nuances of their applications – and the myriad ways they can be designed and built – mean the perceived benefits can vary widely. That said, there are distinct, universally applicable advantages that are evident even now, despite the infancy of the space.\n\nDistributed Intelligence\n\nMASs address a key shortcoming of ABSs, wherein the executing Agent in an ABS might become overwhelmed and falter when confronted with an exceedingly complex task. In an ABS, the first executing Agent is responsible for the detailed planning and implementation of extensive, high-level goals given by the “planning” Agent – a load that can cause the system to buckle. A MAS instead breaks down tasks across multiple Agents recursively, making them far more resilient.\xa0\n\xa0\nIn theory, you could envision an Agent structure that decomposes workflows and tasks into the smallest unit possible: a “task quantum.” A multitude of Agents could then be tasked with handling a singular piece of the overall problem. By divvying up tasks in this way, it’s possible for the system to tackle incredibly complex challenges, simply by having each Agent follow a clear, simple set of instructions.\n\nImagine an architect who designs a grand monument. While the architect can create the blueprint, they almost certainly lack the skills (and the time) to physically construct their vision. Instead, they delegate smaller tasks to teams of workers, who are managed by others experienced in construction tasks. Just as the architect relies on numerous teams to execute their blueprint, a MAS distributes tasks to many Agents to achieve complex goals. Each Agent, the equivalent of a bricklayer in our analogy, might not be able to plan and execute the entire task, but can perform its piece of the task – its task quantum – efficiently and effectively. This accumulation of simple tasks, handled by numerous Agents, ultimately accomplishes the overarching objective.\n\nResearch\nAI Agent Workflow\nScalability\n\nAs the complexity of a problem escalates, more individual Agents can be integrated into the system, rather than whole new Agent-based systems being added. Scalability also relates to the distributed nature of MASs, where tasks and decision-making processes are spread across multiple Agents. This distribution allows the system to handle larger and more complex tasks – without requiring a necessarily proportional increase in computational resources.\n\nParallelism\n\nThe power of MASs isn’t just in distributing tasks. They also benefit from enabling Agents to communicate directly, allowing them to optimize their own workflows.\n\nFor example, as Agents work together on tasks, they share information on their successes or failures – creating a “knowledge network” that helps Agents refine their efforts. If one Agent encounters a setback, it alerts the others, enabling the collective to bypass strategies that have already proven ineffective and preventing duplicate failures.\n\xa0\nConversely, if an Agent finds a successful approach, it shares the insight with the rest, allowing them to focus on and expand this productive pathway. In essence, the Agents are continuously learning from each other\'s experiences, coalescing around promising or unexplored avenues of action. Through this exchange, groups of Agents can more efficiently navigate tasks, minimizing failures and maximizing productivity.\n\nDecentralization\n\nDecentralization is one of the key advantages of Multi-Agent Systems. While Agents in an ABS may be bound by centralized rules and workflows, MASs, by contrast, ensure Agents can survive independently from one another. Unlike in an ABS – where a single breakdown can cascade into a system-wide disruption – if an Agent fails in a MAS, the network will remain intact, simply reassigning that Agent’s tasks.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs Agents take over these and many other aspects of our work, we see our roles transforming in exciting ways: instead of constructing market maps, we’ll evaluate them; instead of building models, we’ll test their assumptions; instead of writing memos, we’ll discuss their implications. In our work, and in most fields, experience earned over years of apprenticeship won’t be replaced, and human-to-human interaction will continue to be the most important driver of value.\n\nAt Activant, we are passionate about the Agent Ecosystem, and this work is only a subset of our research to date. For each of the components we discussed, there are additional considerations and frameworks when applying them to Multi-Agent Systems – everything from the use of Tools across multiple Agents at once to concurrency issues in shared working memory. Additionally, in developing enterprise-ready applications, a few more components are required, such as Agent Security, Compliance Management, Access Provisioning, and Agent Profile Management. On top of all that, we’ve begun diving into how Agents will be built in verticals like fintech, cybersecurity, commerce, and logistics.\n\nIf you’re building in this space, thinking about how to approach using Agents in your organization or just looking to ideate – let’s talk.\n\nSpecial thanks to Teddy Cohen and Drew Peterson, Activant Fellows, for their research contributions.\n\nEndnotes\n\n[1] Ironically, the brick layer will be among the last to be automated. The most automatable tasks are those that have the smallest action space, and while laying bricks may seem relatively simple compared to working in Excel, the reality is a 2-dimensional Excel Workbook has significantly fewer possible actions than a 3-dimensional job site exposed to the elements.\n\n[2] Note, this is similar to Lilian Weng’s Agent System; however, our Ecosystem focuses on the investment landscape, rather than the implementation of Agents.\n\n[3] Fine-tuning as a Service is the process of training a pre-trained model on subject-matter-specific data to produce a model that performs better in specific use cases.\n\n[4] Agent libraries provide the orchestration framework which combines all the components in the Agent Ecosystem.\n\n[5] “APA PsycNet.” American Psychological Association, American Psychological Association, psycnet.apa.org/record/1957-02914-001.

What is an AI agent? What is an autonomous AI agent?

AI agents have been around since the 1980s when computer scientists began exploring how to develop smart software that could interact like humans. Since then, the concept has evolved to include AI agents that can make decisions and complete tasks independently.

An AI agent is a software program designed to interact with its environment, perceive the data it receives, and take actions based on that data to achieve specific goals. AI agents simulate intelligent behavior, and they can be as simple as rule-based systems or as complex as advanced machine learning models. They use predetermined rules or trained models to make decisions and might need external control or supervision.

An autonomous AI agent is an advanced software program that can operate independently without human control. It can think, act, and learn on its own, without needing constant input from humans. These agents are widely used in different industries, like healthcare, finance, and banking, to make things run smoother and more efficiently. They can adjust to new situations, learn from their experiences, and make decisions using their own internal systems.

For example:

AutoGPT is an AI agent that can generate human-like text responses. It can comprehend the context of the conversation and generate relevant responses accordingly.
BabyAGI is an autonomous AI agent that can independently learn and perform tasks like understanding natural language, analyzing images, identifying objects, following simple commands, etc.
AgentGPT is an intelligent virtual agent designed to interact with customers and provide them with personalized recommendations. It can understand natural language and provide relevant responses based on customer queries.

Both AI tools and AI agents can perform tasks autonomously to an extent. So what sets them apart? What qualifies an AI tool as an agent? Let’s find out!

Characteristics of an AI agent

While AI tools and agents are software programs designed to automate tasks, specific key characteristics differentiate AI agents as more sophisticated AI software.

You can consider an AI tool as an AI agent when it has the following characteristics:

Autonomy: An AI virtual agent is capable of performing tasks independently without requiring constant human intervention or input.
Perception: The agent function senses and interprets the environment they operate in through various sensors, such as cameras or microphones.
Reactivity: An AI agent can assess the environment and respond accordingly to achieve its goals.
Reasoning and decision-making: AI agents are intelligent tools that can analyze data and make decisions to achieve goals. They use reasoning techniques and algorithms to process information and take appropriate actions.
Learning: They can learn and enhance their performance through machine, deep, and reinforcement learning elements and techniques.
Communication: AI agents can communicate with other agents or humans using different methods, like understanding and responding to natural language, recognizing speech, and exchanging messages through text.
Goal-oriented: They are designed to achieve specific goals, which can be pre-defined or learned through interactions with the environment.

So far, we have a basic understanding of an agent in AI or intelligent agent definition. But how does an AI agent work? Let’s break it down in the next section as we understand the structure of an agent.

Understanding the structure of an AI agent

At its core, an AI agent is made up of four components: the environment, sensors, actuators, and the decision-making mechanism.

1. Environment

The environment refers to the area or domain in which an AI agent operates. It can be a physical space, like a factory floor, or a digital space, like a website.

2. Sensors

Sensors are the tools that an AI agent uses to perceive its environment. These can be cameras, microphones, or any other sensory input that the AI agent can use to understand what is happening around it.

3. Actuators

Actuators are the tools that an AI agent uses to interact with its environment. These can be things like robotic arms, computer screens, or any other device the AI agent can use to change the environment.

4. Decision-making mechanism

A decision-making mechanism is the brain of an AI agent. It processes the information gathered by the sensors and decides what action to take using the actuators. The decision-making mechanism is where the real magic happens.

AI agents use various decision-making mechanisms, such as rule-based systems, expert systems, and neural networks, to make informed choices and perform tasks effectively.

5. Learning system

The learning system enables the AI agent to learn from its experiences and interactions with the environment. It uses techniques like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning to improve the performance of the AI agent over time.

By understanding the environment, sensors, actuators, and decision-making mechanisms, developers can create AI agents to perform specific tasks accurately and efficiently. As AI technology evolves, we can expect new types of AI agents with even more sophisticated structures and capabilities.

With the AI agent definition and intelligent agent purpose known to you, it’s time to dive deeper into the agent function and analyze how an AI agent works in our upcoming section.

How does an AI agent work?

An AI agent works by perceiving its environment, processing information, and taking action to achieve specific goals or tasks. The process usually involves the following steps:

Step 1: Perceiving the environment

An autonomous AI agent first needs to gather information about its environment. It can do so using sensors or collecting data from various sources.

Step 2: Processing input data

The agent takes the knowledge gathered in Step 1 and prepares it for processing. This may include organizing the data, creating a knowledge base, or making internal representations that the agent can understand and work with.

Step 3: Decision-making

The agent uses reasoning techniques like logic or statistical analysis to make an informed decision based on its knowledge base and goals. This can involve applying pre-determined rules or machine learning algorithms.

Step 4: Planning and executing an action

The agent makes a plan or a series of steps to reach its goals. This may involve creating a step-by-step strategy, optimizing resource allocation, or considering various limitations and priorities. Based on its plan, the agent executes all the steps to achieve the desired goal. It can also receive feedback or new information from the environment, which can be used to adjust its future actions or update its knowledge base.

Step 5: Learning and Improvement

After taking action, the agent can learn from its own experiences. This feedback loop allows the agent to improve performance and adapt to new situations and environments.

In conclusion, autonomous AI agents collect and analyze data, preprocess it, make decisions based on machine learning algorithms, take action, and receive feedback. Now, let us simplify the working of an autonomous AI agent by taking the example of AutoGPT and BabyAGI, the modern-day and most commonly used autonomous agents.

What is AutoGPT?

AutoGPT is like a smart assistant that can handle tasks on its own. It uses the power of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, the Large Language Models (LLMs), to complete tasks without needing constant instructions. Unlike other models that rely on specific prompts, AutoGPT comes up with its own prompts to achieve its goals. Interestingly, its abilities go beyond the fed database; it can also search the web or other external sources to gather and filter out authentic information.

How does AutoGPT work?

Because AutoGPT is a recursive AI model, it overcomes traditional AI limitations by using its own results to tackle complex tasks. Here is how the model processes input and delivers relevant output:

1. Giving it a name and a role: When you start AutoGPT, give it a name and tell it what it needs to do. This helps the system understand the task and make decisions accordingly.

2. Training on the provided data: AutoGPT begins by learning from the information you provide. It studies the data to understand its patterns and details, helping it grasp the task better.

3. Generating prompts: With its knowledge base in place, AutoGPT develops its own prompts based on what it needs to achieve. These prompts serve as the basis for its decision-making, guiding it through the tasks.

4. Collecting data independently: AutoGPT doesn’t rely only on the initial data. It autonomously searches the internet and other sources, gathering more information to improve its understanding and accuracy.

5. Evaluating and filtering data: The system carefully examines the collected data, checking its authenticity and relevance. It removes any incorrect or low-quality information, making sure its knowledge base is reliable.

6. Continuous improvement: AutoGPT believes in constant refinement. It learns from the results it generates and uses feedback to adapt and enhance its future responses. This ongoing process helps the system refine its strategies and improve over time.

7. Generating the output: Finally, AutoGPT produces its output based on its reasoning process. It combines what it has learned, the filtered data, and the context to generate a well-informed and suitable response to the given task.

AutoGPT unveils itself as an independent problem-solver with impressive decision-making skills. It showcases the sheer power of AI, providing a glimpse into the potential of intelligent systems that effortlessly handle complex tasks with minimal human input. Arguably, AutoGPT paves the way for a future where machines become trusted partners in navigating our intricate world.

What is BabyAGI?

BabyAGI is a fascinating concept in the field of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It’s based on generative AI and focuses on recreating the cognitive abilities seen in young children. This research project focuses on building AI systems capable of learning and gaining knowledge from diverse sources, just like young children do!

More specifically, BabyAGI is an advanced computer program that operates with a remarkable level of autonomy. It can work independently, accomplishing tasks without users having to provide specific instructions. BabyAGI is built upon a combination of powerful programs, including Chat GPT-4, LangChain, and Pinecone.

When an AI uses other programs or tools to accomplish tasks, it is known as Stacking. Baby AGI is one of the more robust Stacking tools created and built on Chat GPT-4. You can use this technology for various applications, including language translation, image recognition, and decision-making processes. BabyAGI is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the AI industry.

How does BabyAGI work?

Baby AGI is a Python script that leverages the capabilities of OpenAI and Pinecone APIs, along with the LangChain framework, to manage and execute tasks. Its process involves generating tasks based on high-level objectives predefined by the user.

Using OpenAI’s natural language processing (NLP) abilities, the BabyAGI system creates new tasks aligned with the objectives. Moreover, it uses PineCone to store task results and the LangChain framework to make decisions.

Here’s how the system operates in a loop with four steps:

1. Retrieve the first task from the task list.
2. Send the task to the execution agent, which utilizes the OpenAI API to complete the task based on the available context.
3. Store the result in Pinecone for future reference.
4. Generate and prioritize new tasks based on the previous task’s objective and outcome.

This continuous loop ensures that tasks are consistently executed, prioritized, and updated based on the desired objective.

While the development of a true BabyAGI is still a long way off, there’s daily progress towards a more comprehensive performance. AI experts are actively researching and experimenting to create an AI system that can truly understand and navigate the world like a young human.

From navigating new tasks to swift decision making, their ability to process mass amounts of data and discern patterns allows these agents to derive new insights and act with the relevance required to be an effective tool in today’s world. According to Yann LeCun, pioneer in deep learning and long-time ML engineer, \n\n“Our intelligence is what makes us human, and AI is an extension of that quality.”\n\nThese sophisticated decision-making abilities are fueled by the massive volumes of information they process, allowing these agents to identify relevant patterns, extract meaningful insights, and generate contextually appropriate responses that are beyond simple rule-based approaches. This enables the AI agents to evaluate complex trade-offs and prioritize actions in pursuit of defined goals.\n\nTo truly appreciate this evolution, we have to juxtapose automation and autonomy. Think of today’s AI models like ChatGPT which, while very intelligent, still fall back on human input to guide and manipulate them. Imagine AI agents as autonomous as the self-driving cars we envisioned in 2015. We’re on the cusp of a paradigm shift from partial to full autonomy, ushering in a future with AI sidekicks capable of independent operations–without regular or even frequent human check-ins.\n\nUse Cases\n\nThe advent of GPT-4 (and other highly advanced instructional models) has ushered a new wave of innovation. It’s unleashing a whole host of applications where autonomous AI agents can truly shine. These agents have shown an aptitude for incorporating large data sets and transforming them into valuable insights based on large-scale pattern recognition. This shift is empowering organizations to navigate their path to success with unprecedented confidence, and elevating user experiences along the way.\n\n1.

AI agents are now able to predict potential health crises by analyzing patient data over time, thereby preempting issues before they can become critical. This isn\'t simply about better diagnostics; it’s about revolutionizing healthcare by moving from a reactive to a proactive approach, lowering long-term medical costs and improving public health as best we can.  \n\n2. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND ETHICAL INVESTMENTS:\n\nThe financial sector’s consistently been a hotbed for tech and AI innovations the last few years, particularly when it comes to high-frequency trading.  AI capabilities are able to tackle problems such as risk assessment faster, and more accurately, than their human counterparts. Rather than merely relying on historical data of stock performance, these agents now factor in geopolitical events, emerging market trends, and societal shifts among other variables. Cutting-edge AI algorithms can scan markets, recognize trends, and make swift trading decisions. AI is creating a new kind of intelligence; reshaping industries and empowering organizations to make better predictions faster, driving better outcomes and gaining a competitive edge in their respective industries. Furthermore, with the recent rise in ethical investing, autonomous AI agents make it much easier to sift through corporate data and gauge a company’s environmental or social impact, while fine tuning its choices to better align with your social and political stances, particularly when it comes to making ethical investment decisions.\n\n3. BRIDGING THE ONLINE/OFFLINE RETAIL EXPERIENCE:\n\nWhile personalization has been the long-held cornerstone of online retail success for companies like Amazon, our physical shopping experience has largely remained the same. However, with the use of AI and augmented reality, we can merge the customizability of the online retail experience with the tactile satisfaction of shopping. Imagine walking into a store where AI, though augmented reality interfaces, are able to  provide product recommendations based on your online history. By integrating the personalized touch of the digital age into traditional shopping, AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we do the mundane.  \n\nBenefits, Opportunities, & Potential Drawbacks\n\nAutonomous AI can work without rest, tackling repetitive tasks like data entry and analysis with unfailing precision. Through the augmentation of AI and human agents, efficiency, productivity, and scalability can be improved with minimal costs. Exemplifying this are AI chatbots, who are able to provide rapid customer service, regardless of the time of day, at the customer’s convenience. Further, the almost overnight improvements of large language models has enabled chatbots to understand and generate human-like natural language, enabling more effective customer service platforms.\xa0\xa0\n\nConversational AI agents, such as ChatGPT and Bing Chat,\xa0 can provide a seamless user experience by understanding and responding to user queries.

Characteristics, Advantages, Challenges, Applications\n\nImagine having a personal assistant who never sleeps, never gets tired, and can handle an infinite number of tasks on its own. That’s the power of AI agents, the superheroes of the artificial intelligence era.\n\nWith the advent of agents such as AutoGPT, BabyAGI, AgentGPT, etc., a whole new chapter has been added to the AI horizon. These innovative platforms are creating new opportunities for businesses and individuals alike. With the continuous evolution of AI, there will be endless possibilities for using autonomous AI agents. But, hey, first of all,\n\nUnlock the power of AI/ML with Simform’s Artificial Intelligence Development Services. From chatbots to predictive analytics, we can help you build custom solutions that transform your business. Contact us today to explore AI/ML applications for your business.\n\nWhat is an AI agent? What is an autonomous AI agent?\n\nAI agents have been around since the 1980s when computer scientists began exploring how to develop smart software that could interact like humans. Since then, the concept has evolved to include AI agents that can make decisions and complete tasks independently.\n\nAn AI agent is a software program designed to interact with its environment, perceive the data it receives, and take actions based on that data to achieve specific goals. AI agents simulate intelligent behavior, and they can be as simple as rule-based systems or as complex as advanced machine learning models. They use predetermined rules or trained models to make decisions and might need external control or supervision.\n\nAn autonomous AI agent is an advanced software program that can operate independently without human control. It can think, act, and learn on its own, without needing constant input from humans. These agents are widely used in different industries, like healthcare, finance, and banking, to make things run smoother and more efficiently. They can adjust to new situations, learn from their experiences, and make decisions using their own internal systems.\n\nFor example:\n\nAutoGPT is an AI agent that can generate human-like text responses. It can comprehend the context of the conversation and generate relevant responses accordingly.\nBabyAGI is an autonomous AI agent that can independently learn and perform tasks like understanding natural language, analyzing images, identifying objects, following simple commands, etc.\nAgentGPT is an intelligent virtual agent designed to interact with customers and provide them with personalized recommendations. It can understand natural language and provide relevant responses based on customer queries.\n\nBoth AI tools and AI agents can perform tasks autonomously to an extent. So what sets them apart? What qualifies an AI tool as an agent? Let’s find out!\n\nCharacteristics of an AI agent\n\nWhile AI tools and agents are software programs designed to automate tasks, specific key characteristics differentiate AI agents as more sophisticated AI software.\n\nYou can consider an AI tool as an AI agent when it has the following characteristics:\n\nAutonomy: An AI virtual agent is capable of performing tasks independently without requiring constant human intervention or input.\nPerception: The agent function senses and interprets the environment they operate in through various sensors, such as cameras or microphones.\nReactivity: An AI agent can assess the environment and respond accordingly to achieve its goals.\nReasoning and decision-making: AI agents are intelligent tools that can analyze data and make decisions to achieve goals. They use reasoning techniques and algorithms to process information and take appropriate actions.\nLearning: They can learn and enhance their performance through machine, deep, and reinforcement learning elements and techniques.\nCommunication: AI agents can communicate with other agents or humans using different methods, like understanding and responding to natural language, recognizing speech, and exchanging messages through text.\nGoal-oriented: They are designed to achieve specific goals, which can be pre-defined or learned through interactions with the environment.\n\nSo far, we have a basic understanding of an agent in AI or intelligent agent definition. But how does an AI agent work? Let’s break it down in the next section as we understand the structure of an agent.\n\nUnderstanding the structure of an AI agent\n\nAt its core, an AI agent is made up of four components: the environment, sensors, actuators, and the decision-making mechanism.\n\n1. Environment\n\nThe environment refers to the area or domain in which an AI agent operates. It can be a physical space, like a factory floor, or a digital space, like a website.\n\n2. Sensors\n\nSensors are the tools that an AI agent uses to perceive its environment. These can be cameras, microphones, or any other sensory input that the AI agent can use to understand what is happening around it.\n\n3. Actuators\n\nActuators are the tools that an AI agent uses to interact with its environment. These can be things like robotic arms, computer screens, or any other device the AI agent can use to change the environment.\n\n4. Decision-making mechanism\n\nA decision-making mechanism is the brain of an AI agent. It processes the information gathered by the sensors and decides what action to take using the actuators. The decision-making mechanism is where the real magic happens.\n\nAI agents use various decision-making mechanisms, such as rule-based systems, expert systems, and neural networks, to make informed choices and perform tasks effectively.\n\n5. Learning system\n\nThe learning system enables the AI agent to learn from its experiences and interactions with the environment. It uses techniques like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning to improve the performance of the AI agent over time.\n\nBy understanding the environment, sensors, actuators, and decision-making mechanisms, developers can create AI agents to perform specific tasks accurately and efficiently. As AI technology evolves, we can expect new types of AI agents with even more sophisticated structures and capabilities.\n\nWith the AI agent definition and intelligent agent purpose known to you, it’s time to dive deeper into the agent function and analyze how an AI agent works in our upcoming section.\n\nHow does an AI agent work?\n\nAn AI agent works by perceiving its environment, processing information, and taking action to achieve specific goals or tasks. The process usually involves the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Perceiving the environment\n\nAn autonomous AI agent first needs to gather information about its environment. It can do so using sensors or collecting data from various sources.\n\nStep 2: Processing input data\n\nThe agent takes the knowledge gathered in Step 1 and prepares it for processing. This may include organizing the data, creating a knowledge base, or making internal representations that the agent can understand and work with.\n\nStep 3: Decision-making\n\nThe agent uses reasoning techniques like logic or statistical analysis to make an informed decision based on its knowledge base and goals. This can involve applying pre-determined rules or machine learning algorithms.\n\nStep 4: Planning and executing an action\n\nThe agent makes a plan or a series of steps to reach its goals. This may involve creating a step-by-step strategy, optimizing resource allocation, or considering various limitations and priorities. Based on its plan, the agent executes all the steps to achieve the desired goal. It can also receive feedback or new information from the environment, which can be used to adjust its future actions or update its knowledge base.\n\nStep 5: Learning and Improvement\n\nAfter taking action, the agent can learn from its own experiences. This feedback loop allows the agent to improve performance and adapt to new situations and environments.\n\nIn conclusion, autonomous AI agents collect and analyze data, preprocess it, make decisions based on machine learning algorithms, take action, and receive feedback. Now, let us simplify the working of an autonomous AI agent by taking the example of AutoGPT and BabyAGI, the modern-day and most commonly used autonomous agents.\n\nWhat is AutoGPT?\n\nAutoGPT is like a smart assistant that can handle tasks on its own. It uses the power of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, the Large Language Models (LLMs), to complete tasks without needing constant instructions. Unlike other models that rely on specific prompts, AutoGPT comes up with its own prompts to achieve its goals. Interestingly, its abilities go beyond the fed database; it can also search the web or other external sources to gather and filter out authentic information.\n\nHow does AutoGPT work?\n\nBecause AutoGPT is a recursive AI model, it overcomes traditional AI limitations by using its own results to tackle complex tasks. Here is how the model processes input and delivers relevant output:\n\n1. Giving it a name and a role: When you start AutoGPT, give it a name and tell it what it needs to do. This helps the system understand the task and make decisions accordingly.\n\n2. Training on the provided data: AutoGPT begins by learning from the information you provide. It studies the data to understand its patterns and details, helping it grasp the task better.\n\n3. Generating prompts: With its knowledge base in place, AutoGPT develops its own prompts based on what it needs to achieve. These prompts serve as the basis for its decision-making, guiding it through the tasks.\n\n4. Collecting data independently: AutoGPT doesn’t rely only on the initial data. It autonomously searches the internet and other sources, gathering more information to improve its understanding and accuracy.\n\n5. Evaluating and filtering data: The system carefully examines the collected data, checking its authenticity and relevance. It removes any incorrect or low-quality information, making sure its knowledge base is reliable.\n\n6. Continuous improvement: AutoGPT believes in constant refinement. It learns from the results it generates and uses feedback to adapt and enhance its future responses. This ongoing process helps the system refine its strategies and improve over time.\n\n7. Generating the output: Finally, AutoGPT produces its output based on its reasoning process. It combines what it has learned, the filtered data, and the context to generate a well-informed and suitable response to the given task.\n\nAutoGPT unveils itself as an independent problem-solver with impressive decision-making skills. It showcases the sheer power of AI, providing a glimpse into the potential of intelligent systems that effortlessly handle complex tasks with minimal human input. Arguably, AutoGPT paves the way for a future where machines become trusted partners in navigating our intricate world.\n\nWhat is BabyAGI?\n\nBabyAGI is a fascinating concept in the field of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It’s based on generative AI and focuses on recreating the cognitive abilities seen in young children. This research project focuses on building AI systems capable of learning and gaining knowledge from diverse sources, just like young children do!\n\nMore specifically, BabyAGI is an advanced computer program that operates with a remarkable level of autonomy. It can work independently, accomplishing tasks without users having to provide specific instructions. BabyAGI is built upon a combination of powerful programs, including Chat GPT-4, LangChain, and Pinecone.\n\nWhen an AI uses other programs or tools to accomplish tasks, it is known as Stacking. Baby AGI is one of the more robust Stacking tools created and built on Chat GPT-4. You can use this technology for various applications, including language translation, image recognition, and decision-making processes. BabyAGI is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the AI industry.\n\nHow does BabyAGI work?\n\nBaby AGI is a Python script that leverages the capabilities of OpenAI and Pinecone APIs, along with the LangChain framework, to manage and execute tasks. Its process involves generating tasks based on high-level objectives predefined by the user.\n\nUsing OpenAI’s natural language processing (NLP) abilities, the BabyAGI system creates new tasks aligned with the objectives. Moreover, it uses PineCone to store task results and the LangChain framework to make decisions.\n\nHere’s how the system operates in a loop with four steps:\n\n1. Retrieve the first task from the task list.\n2. Send the task to the execution agent, which utilizes the OpenAI API to complete the task based on the available context.\n3. Store the result in Pinecone for future reference.\n4. Generate and prioritize new tasks based on the previous task’s objective and outcome.\n\nThis continuous loop ensures that tasks are consistently executed, prioritized, and updated based on the desired objective.\n\nWhile the development of a true BabyAGI is still a long way off, there’s daily progress towards a more comprehensive performance. AI experts are actively researching and experimenting to create an AI system that can truly understand and navigate the world like a young human.\n\nWhat are the type of AI agents?\n\nHere are the five main types of AI agents:\n\nSimple reflex agents are programmed to respond to specific environmental stimuli based on pre-defined rules.\nModel-based reflex agents are reactive agents that maintain an internal model of the environment and use it to make decisions.\nGoal-based agents execute a program to achieve specific goals and take actions based on evaluating the current state of the environment.\nUtility-based agents consider the potential outcomes of their actions and choose the one that maximizes the expected utility.\nLearning agents execute machine learning techniques to improve their decision-making over time.\nWhat are the advantages of using AI agents?\n\nAI agents offer businesses the potential to streamline operations, make informed decisions, improve customer experiences, and drive growth and competitiveness in the digital age.\n\n1.

Agents, LLMs and the New Wave of Smart Apps

When you hear the word Agent, you might think of 007 or Jason Bourne. They can fight crime with one hand, down a Martini with the other, and always look stylish doing it. 

But since the release of ChatGPT, we've seen an explosion of a new kind of agent. AI Agents are intelligent programs that can interact autonomously or semi-autonomously with their environment. 

Actually, the definition of Agents is still evolving at the moment. The traditional definition is any autonomous software that tries to achieve its goals, whether in the digital world or physical world or both. It's got sensors that "see" and "hear" and "sense" its environment. It's got "actuators," a fancy word for the tools it uses to interact with the world, whether that's an LLM using an API the way we use our hands and fingers, or whether it's a robotic gripper picking up trash or a self-driving car sensing the environment with LIDAR.

But Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4, based on the ultra-popular Transformer architecture, changed what is possible with Agent capabilities. For the first time they give us little "brains" that are capable of a wide range of tasks from planning and reasoning, to answering questions and making decisions that were impossible with earlier models. 

LLMs have a number of well known flaws, such as hallucinations, which essentially boils down to making things up, to ingesting the biases of the dataset it was trained on, all the way to an LLM having confidence in wrong answers because of a lack of grounding. Grounding means that the model can't link the text it's generating to real world knowledge. It may not know for a fact that the world is round and so occasionally hallucinates that it's flat. 

But despite all these imperfections LLMs remain very powerful tools. We asked GPT-4 a logic teaser question and it gave us the right answer out of the gate, something smaller LLMs struggle with badly and that no hand written code could deal with on its own without knowing the question in advance.

A recent report from Andreessen Horowitz on emerging LLM stacks sees Agents as purely autonomous pieces of software. That means they can plan and make decisions totally independent of human intervention. 

At the AI Infrastructure Alliance (AIIA), we define Agents a bit differently. We see them as both semi-autonomous software with humans making some of the decisions, aka humans in the loop, as well as fully autonomous systems too. We also think it's essential that people understand that an Agent is not usually a singular, self contained piece of software, such as the LLM itself. We hear the word Agent and it calls to mind a complete entity that is self contained, mostly because we anthropomorphize them and think of them as human, since people are the only benchmark we have for true intelligence. 

Usually Agents are a system of interconnected software pieces. The HuggingGPT paper from a Microsoft Research team outlines a common and practical approach to modern agents, where an LLM uses other models, like an image diffuser, such as Stable Diffusion XL, or a coding model like WizardCoder, to do more advanced tasks. It may also use APIs the way we use our hands and legs. It uses those tools as an extension to control outside software or interact with the world. To do that an LLM might train on its own API knowledge as part of its dataset or a fine-tuned dataset or it might use another external model explicitly trained on APIs, like Gorilla.

At the AIIA, we see Agents and any software system that interacts with the physical or digital world and that can make decisions that were usually only in the realm of human cognition in the past.

We call semi-autonomous agents: Centaurs. These are intelligent software with a human in the loop. 
Agents are fully autonomous or almost fully autonomous pieces of software that can plan and make complex decisions without human intervention. 

We can think of a Centaur as a "Agents on rails", a precursor to fully autonomous Agents. Centaurs can accomplish complex tasks as long as they're well defined with clear guardrails and as long as someone is checking their work or intervening at various steps along the way.

Agents that are fully autonomous and can do their job with no human intervention. 

A good example of the levels of autonomy in agentic systems comes from the world of self-driving cars and is beautifully laid out in the book AI 2041 by Kai-Fu Lee and Chen Quifan. Autonomous systems are classified by the Society of Automotive Engineers as Level 0 (L0) to Level 5 (L5):

L0 (zero automation) means the person does all the driving but the AI watches the road and alerts the driver to potential problems such as following another car too closely. 
L1 (hands on) means the AI can do a specific task, like steering, as long as the driver is paying close attention.
L2 (hands off) is where the AI can do multiple tasks like braking, steering, accelerating and turning, but the system still expects the human to supervise and take over when needed.
L3 (eyes off) is when an AI can take over all aspects of driving but still needs the human to be ready to take over if something goes wrong or the AI makes a mistake. 
L4 (mind off) is where the AI can take over driving completely for an entire trip, but only on well defined roads and in well developed environments that AI understands very well, like highways and city streets that have been extensively mapped and surveyed in high definition
L5 (steering wheel optional) means that no human is required at all, for any roads or environment and you don't need to have a way for humans to take over, hence the "steering wheel" optional.

We can think of L0 to L3 as nothing but an extra option on a new car, like air conditioning or leather seats or cruise control. They still need humans at the wheel. These are Centaurs in that they need humans in the loop, like most Agents today. Most people would be very reluctant to let an Agent compose an email to their boss or their mother without reading it before sending it. 

But by the time we get to L4, the intelligence behind the car starts to feel like a true intelligence with a mind of its own and it will have a massive impact on society. L4 cars or buses might be public transport that take very specific public routes confidently, while an L5 car or truck might do deliveries at all hours of the day or be a robot taxi like Uber that can take you anywhere.

Since the release of GPT 3 and GPT 4 we've seen a number of attempts to build fully autonomous L5 style Agents for the digital world, such as BabyAGI and AutoGPT, as well as a slew of others. Programmers have looked to leverage LLMs to take actions like planning complex software requirements, booking plane tickets based on user requests, picking out presents for a birthday party or planning out company hiring plans.

Unfortunately, they mostly don't work yet for long term planning, reasoning and execution of complex tasks. We imagine AI systems that can come up with a comprehensive marketing plan for a new product, write and create the website, craft all the outreach messages, get the list of people to reach out to and then send the emails to get new customers. We are not there yet but that doesn't mean they won't at some point. With so many traditional programmers getting into machine learning and applying ideas that data scientists and data engineers wouldn't think of because it's outside their domain knowledge, we're seeing improvements constantly in these systems and fully autonomous Agents could be a ubiquitous facet of all our lives in the near future or over the next decade.

Many of these fully autonomous projects sparked tremendous public interest. AutoGPT racked up GitHub stars faster than almost any project in history but we can no longer take GitHub stars as a true measure of software prowess. The tremendous public interest in AI, which is often driven by sci-fi novels and Hollywood blockbusters and not by the actual reality of the current state of the technology. That outside interest sometimes drives brand new projects to the Github star stratosphere, only to see actual developer interest in those projects crumble soon after. That happens when cognitive dissonance sets in and the software doesn't end up matching people's expectations of a super-intelligent software avatar, like the AI in the fantastic movie Her.

Still, some of those projects continue to attract ardent followers who continue to add new capabilities, such as with BabyAGI. Not only that but reasoning and planning for Agents continues to evolve with software and research projects that incorporate new techniques to help the LLMs think better, such as Chain of Thought prompting, or giving them a history that they can recall with projects like the Generative Simulacra from a team out of Stanford, which "extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior." 

Despite all these techniques they still struggle with going off the rails and hallucinating and making major mistakes in their thinking, especially as the time horizon for independent decision making increases. Short term, on-the-rails reasoning is often sound but the longer the agents have to act and make decisions on their own the larger their chance of breaking down.

Even with all these limitations and caveats, Agents have gotten more powerful. Why have Agents suddenly gotten much more powerful? The answer is simple. ChatGPT was a watershed moment in computing and AI history that shocked outsiders and insiders alike. 

Suddenly, we had a system that delivered realistic and free flowing conversations on any subject at any time. That's a radical departure from the past where chatbots were brittle and not even vaguely human. The first chatbot, ELIZA, was created in the 1960s at MIT. We've had Clippy, the famous paperclip in Microsoft Office products in the late 90s and early 2000s that was notorious for being slow and virtually useless for answering any questions at all. We've had Alexa and Siri which can do things like play songs or answer questions by doing lookups in a database. But none of them really worked all that well. 

ChatGPT and GPT-4 just feel different. 

That's because all these bots of the past were often brittle rule based systems. They were glorified scripts that triggered based on what you said or wrote. They couldn't adapt to you or your tone or writing style. They had no real context about the larger conversation you'd had with them. They felt static and unintelligent. Nobody would mistake them for humans.

The architecture of GPT-4 is a secret, though we know its based on transformers. We'd had speculation that it's a massive transformer with a trillion parameters of that it's not a big model at all but 8 smaller models, known as a Mixture of Experts (MoE), which leverages a suite of smaller expert models to do different tasks. Whatever the actual architecture of the model is, which we will only know when its architecture is officially made public, it's a model that's more powerful and capable than any other model on the market and it remains the high water mark as of the time of this writing. Even with models like Meta's open source marvel Llama 2 that came out a year later can't seem to replicate its performance, though they approach it. 

That said, it's only a matter of time before other teams create a more powerful model. By the time you read this the arms race to create ever more powerful models by open source teams like Eleuther AI and Meta's AI research division, or by any of the proprietary companies piling up GPUs to build their own models, like Google, Anthropic, Cohere, Inflection, Aleph Alpha, Mistral and Adept may already have produced that model.

With more powerful software brains powering today's Agents, we have much more powerful systems at hand. They're the engine that drive Centaurs and Agents to much more useful capabilities. Unlike the relatively limited capabilities of enterprise Robotic Process Automation (RPA) of the past, that were typically limited to well defined processes and structured data, we have Agents and AI driven applications that can work in the unstructured world of websites, documents and software APIs. These Agents can summarize websites with ease, understand what's going on the text, offer an opinion, act as language tutors and research assistants and much, much more. 

It's really only the beginning. ChatGPT was the starting point but not the end game. Since GPT, we've had a surge of capable open source models. Hugging Face tracks them with an open suite of tests on a leaderboard for open source models. It seems like every week a new open source model takes the crown. We've seen Meta's LLaMA and Llama 2, along with Vicuna, Orca, Falcon, not to mention specialized models like Gorilla that specializes in working with APIs. 

Venture capital is pouring into foundation model companies so they can spin up massive supercomputers of GPUs. OpenAI attracted over 10B USD in investments and recently Inflection AI announced 1.3B USD in funding to create a 22,000 strong Nvidia H100 cluster to train their latest models. With all that capital, OpenAI will not remain the only game in town. At the AIIA we expect a massive flurry of capable models to power the intelligence apps of today and tomorrow.

Agents offer a potentially new kind of software that's beyond the capabilities of traditional hand coded software written by expert programmers. The power of these LLMs and the middleware that's rising up around them makes it possible for very small teams to build highly capable AI driven applications with one to ten people. It's an extension of the WhatsApp effect, where a small team of 50 developers was able to reach 300M people with their application because they were able to leverage an ever increasing stack of sophisticated pre-baked software to build their platform, everything from ready-made UIs to secure encryption libraries. 

The power of LLMs, along with a suite of models that do a particular task very well, like SAM (Segment Anything Model), Stable Diffusion, Gen1 and Gen 2, coupled with a new generation of middleware is making it possible for even smaller teams to reach a wider audience. The bar to building great software has lowered again and history shows that whenever that happens we see a flurry of new applications.

It's also possible to build smaller, more focused apps now, like a bot that can ingest a series of legal documents and answer questions about what jurisdictions a company might face lawsuits in, an app that can research a massive amount of companies and tell you which ones are good for your marketing team to contact, or an app that can ingest news articles, write summaries of them and create a newsletter. Stacking these agents together holds the potential of creating intelligent microservices that can deliver new kinds of functionality. 

With state of the art LLMs behind the scenes that are broadly capable and able to power agents whose sensory input from keystrokes, web pages, code, external models and knowledge repositories, we now have Agents that can do things we only saw in the movies, like automatically upscale photos and add detail to them that was hidden or missing, reason about what is on a web page or in a PDF document and make complex decisions. An old writer's trope in every detective show is where the cops find some grainy VHS footage and their computer team ‘enhances' that footage to get the next big clue in the case. That was basically impossible but now we have systems that are a lot like the Bladerunner scene where Detective Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, takes an old photo, puts it into an analysis machine, talks to the machine and tells it what to do, and the machine enhances the photo to bring out hidden spots.

We've gone from only robotics researchers and data scientists building Agents, to traditional programmers building Agents to do complex tasks that were impossible only a short time again with hand written code and heuristics. 

But despite all these amazing new capabilities none of this is without its challenges. LLMs are non-deterministic systems and they don't always behave or act in a way that's predictable. A traditional hand written piece of software can only fail in so many ways. If we have a subroutine that logs a user into a website there are only so many ways it can go wrong. But LLMs and other models can produce wildly unpredictable results from task to task. A diffusion model like Stable Diffusion XL might excel at creating photorealistic portraits but fail miserably at making a cartoon style painting of a cute robot. Even worse, because these systems are so open ended, there is no real way to test all of the possibilities that someone might use them for on a given day. One user might ask the LLM simple questions about how to make a good dinner for their wife, while another might try to trick it into revealing security information, while still another might ask it to do complex math.

Wrangling these systems to create useful software is an ongoing challenge. So lets dive in and look at the promises and perils of LLMs, Generative AI and Agents for both small business and enterprises. We'll start with the new emerging stack that's enabling people to create these applications and then move on to challenges every company or person looking to adopt or build these systems will face.

KEY CHARTS

We’ve discovered that the teams surveyed often faced their biggest challenges with collecting the data they need along with cleaning, QAing and transforming that data, which falls squarely on the shoulders of data engineers.

That’s reflected in the composition of teams as well. Most companies surveyed employed more data engineers than data scientists. It’s also reflected in where teams are spending the most time and money.

Only 26% of teams we surveyed were very satisfied with their current AI/ML infrastructure. 55% percent were only somewhat satisfied, while 17% were somewhat unsatisfied, and 3% were very unsatisfied. In other words, most teams see a lot of room for improvement.

 

This is the information we needed to make much better decisions about what's out there and what's ready for prime time in machine learning infrastructure.

Majorly used in remote locations, the Artificial Intelligence operated devices have internal settings which do not need any human interventions. The autonomous agents majorly contribute to the industry verticals such as BFSI, IT & telecom, manufacturing, healthcare, transportation & mobility. Autonomous agents are most fit for applications that require communication between segments, detecting, sensing or monitoring of the environment, or autonomous operation activity. Since agent specialists can analyze on their own (for example, draw deductions), they can easily perform complex tasks dependent on messages they get, their convictions, and their general objectives and goals.\n\nFor instance, while purchasing services or products, the devices used are known as buying agents. These agents search for various options available on the internet and compare them with the requirements provided by the user. Also, autonomous agents can be used for data mining, analyzing the trends and patterns from different data sources. The agents can also detect the minute changes and alarms the user if any unusual activities are identified. The other application of autonomous agent is monitoring and surveillance.\n\nKey Market Driver -\n\n• Rising requirements for handling growing unstructured and complex data sets • Growing adoption of Cloud-based solutions and Artificial Intelligence technology\n\nKey Market Restraint -\n\n• The high capital cost associated with autonomous agents\n\nKEY PLAYERS COVERED:\n\nSome of the key players in autonomous agents market are Oracle Corporation, International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation, SAP SE, Amazon.Com Inc., SAS Institute Inc., Infosys Ltd., Nuance Communications, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO), Fetch.ai, Intel Corporation, Salesforce.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. (Google) and Microsoft Corporation among others.\n\nIn self-driving vehicles, autonomous agents need to settle on a sequence of decisions so that it can adjust to the external environment or to conduct different input from agents, especially to avoid collisions and recover to safe conditions. The AI providers observed that when the required information is not available, it becomes challenging for AI to operate. IBM research team is working on such operations by using various applications and came up with real-time sequential decision-making by autonomous agents.\n\nREGIONAL ANALYSIS:\n\nTo gain extensive insights into the market, Request For Customization\n\nNorth America has implemented AI solutions from the early stage of the market. It is expected to see even more substantial developments over the coming years. The complex process of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is boosting the adoption of autonomous agents. Artificial Intelligence has applications in almost all the industry sectors which can produce high efficiency and boost performance. Europe is likely to be the second large region to adopt autonomous agents. UK can expand its economic benefits with the implementation of AI Artificial Intelligence on a large basis. The data generated is increasing with the rising implementation of AI and IoT technology, which will require real-time autonomous agents to communicate and process the program. The adoption of autonomous agents in the APAC, especially in India and China are expected to rise owing to its applications.\n\nSEGMENTATION\n\n\xa0ATTRIBUTE\n\n\t\xa0DETAILS\n\n\nBy Deployment Type\n\n\t\nCloud\nOn-premises\n\n\n\nBy \xa0Organization Size\n\n\t\nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprises\nLarge Enterprises\n\n\n\nBy Industry Vertical\n\n\t\nBFSI\nIT and Telecom\nManufacturing\nHealthcare\nTransportation and Mobility\n\n\n\nBy Geography\n\n\t\nNorth America (USA and Canada)\nEurope (UK, Germany, France, Scandinavia and Rest of Europe)\nAsia Pacific (Japan, China, India and Rest of Asia Pacific)\nMiddle East & Africa (South Africa, GCC and Rest of the Middle East & Africa)\nLatin America (Brazil, Mexico and Rest of Latin America)\nKEY INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS\nOctober 2018: Oracle’s newly launched “Star Wars Cyber Defences”, blocks threats with the cloud control computers network, and ‘Autonomous Robots’ – artificial intelligence- and machine learning-based robots detects and take required actions instantly.\nJanuary 2019: To study how AI agents communicate with each other Google and Facebook have come together, a strategy that uses an arrangement of remunerations to drive agents toward specific objectives — while "playing" a series of games demonstrated showed a portion of the linguistic phenomena.\nREQUEST SAMPLE\nSPEAK TO ANALYST\nPUBLISHING STATUS:\nOngoing\nBASE YEAR:\n2022\nHISTORICAL DATA:\n2019-2021\nCHOOSE LICENSE TYPE\nSingle User - \n$4850\nMulti User - $5850\nEnterprise - \n$6850\nCompare Licenses\n Request Brochure\n Ask For Customization\n Get a Quote\n Inquire Before Buying\nPersonalize this Research\nGranular Research on Specified Regions or Segments\nCompanies Profiled based on User Requirement\nBroader Insights Pertaining to a Specific Segment or Region\nBreaking Down Competitive Landscape as per Your Requirement\nOther Specific Requirement on Customization\nClient Testimonials\n\n“Thank you for sending the market report and data.

FREE.\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW\nREPORT PREVIEW\n\nCheck Out the First Section Below\n\nAgents, LLMs and the New Wave of Smart Apps\n\nWhen you hear the word Agent, you might think of 007 or Jason Bourne. They can fight crime with one hand, down a Martini with the other, and always look stylish doing it.\xa0\n\nBut since the release of ChatGPT, we\'ve seen an explosion of a new kind of agent. AI Agents are intelligent programs that can interact autonomously or semi-autonomously with their environment.\xa0\n\nActually, the definition of Agents is still evolving at the moment. The traditional definition is any autonomous software that tries to achieve its goals, whether in the digital world or physical world or both. It\'s got sensors that "see" and "hear" and "sense" its environment. It\'s got "actuators," a fancy word for the tools it uses to interact with the world, whether that\'s an LLM using an API the way we use our hands and fingers, or whether it\'s a robotic gripper picking up trash or a self-driving car sensing the environment with LIDAR.\n\nBut Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4, based on the ultra-popular Transformer architecture, changed what is possible with Agent capabilities. For the first time they give us little "brains" that are capable of a wide range of tasks from planning and reasoning, to answering questions and making decisions that were impossible with earlier models.\xa0\n\nLLMs have a number of well known flaws, such as hallucinations, which essentially boils down to making things up, to ingesting the biases of the dataset it was trained on, all the way to an LLM having confidence in wrong answers because of a lack of grounding. Grounding means that the model can\'t link the text it\'s generating to real world knowledge. It may not know for a fact that the world is round and so occasionally hallucinates that it\'s flat.\xa0\n\nBut despite all these imperfections LLMs remain very powerful tools. We asked GPT-4 a logic teaser question and it gave us the right answer out of the gate, something smaller LLMs struggle with badly and that no hand written code could deal with on its own without knowing the question in advance.\n\nA recent report from Andreessen Horowitz on emerging LLM stacks sees Agents as purely autonomous pieces of software. That means they can plan and make decisions totally independent of human intervention.\xa0\n\nAt the AI Infrastructure Alliance (AIIA), we define Agents a bit differently. We see them as both semi-autonomous software with humans making some of the decisions, aka humans in the loop, as well as fully autonomous systems too. We also think it\'s essential that people understand that an Agent is not usually a singular, self contained piece of software, such as the LLM itself. We hear the word Agent and it calls to mind a complete entity that is self contained, mostly because we anthropomorphize them and think of them as human, since people are the only benchmark we have for true intelligence.\xa0\n\nUsually Agents are a system of interconnected software pieces. The HuggingGPT paper from a Microsoft Research team outlines a common and practical approach to modern agents, where an LLM uses other models, like an image diffuser, such as Stable Diffusion XL, or a coding model like WizardCoder, to do more advanced tasks. It may also use APIs the way we use our hands and legs. It uses those tools as an extension to control outside software or interact with the world. To do that an LLM might train on its own API knowledge as part of its dataset or a fine-tuned dataset or it might use another external model explicitly trained on APIs, like Gorilla.\n\nAt the AIIA, we see Agents and any software system that interacts with the physical or digital world and that can make decisions that were usually only in the realm of human cognition in the past.\n\nWe call semi-autonomous agents: Centaurs. These are intelligent software with a human in the loop.\xa0\nAgents are fully autonomous or almost fully autonomous pieces of software that can plan and make complex decisions without human intervention.\xa0\n\nWe can think of a Centaur as a "Agents on rails", a precursor to fully autonomous Agents. Centaurs can accomplish complex tasks as long as they\'re well defined with clear guardrails and as long as someone is checking their work or intervening at various steps along the way.\n\nAgents that are fully autonomous and can do their job with no human intervention.\xa0\n\nA good example of the levels of autonomy in agentic systems comes from the world of self-driving cars and is beautifully laid out in the book AI 2041 by Kai-Fu Lee and Chen Quifan. Autonomous systems are classified by the Society of Automotive Engineers as Level 0 (L0) to Level 5 (L5):\n\nL0 (zero automation) means the person does all the driving but the AI watches the road and alerts the driver to potential problems such as following another car too closely.\xa0\nL1 (hands on) means the AI can do a specific task, like steering, as long as the driver is paying close attention.\nL2 (hands off) is where the AI can do multiple tasks like braking, steering, accelerating and turning, but the system still expects the human to supervise and take over when needed.\nL3 (eyes off) is when an AI can take over all aspects of driving but still needs the human to be ready to take over if something goes wrong or the AI makes a mistake.\xa0\nL4 (mind off) is where the AI can take over driving completely for an entire trip, but only on well defined roads and in well developed environments that AI understands very well, like highways and city streets that have been extensively mapped and surveyed in high definition\nL5 (steering wheel optional) means that no human is required at all, for any roads or environment and you don\'t need to have a way for humans to take over, hence the "steering wheel" optional.\n\nWe can think of L0 to L3 as nothing but an extra option on a new car, like air conditioning or leather seats or cruise control. They still need humans at the wheel. These are Centaurs in that they need humans in the loop, like most Agents today. Most people would be very reluctant to let an Agent compose an email to their boss or their mother without reading it before sending it.\xa0\n\nBut by the time we get to L4, the intelligence behind the car starts to feel like a true intelligence with a mind of its own and it will have a massive impact on society. L4 cars or buses might be public transport that take very specific public routes confidently, while an L5 car or truck might do deliveries at all hours of the day or be a robot taxi like Uber that can take you anywhere.\n\nSince the release of GPT 3 and GPT 4 we\'ve seen a number of attempts to build fully autonomous L5 style Agents for the digital world, such as BabyAGI and AutoGPT, as well as a slew of others. Programmers have looked to leverage LLMs to take actions like planning complex software requirements, booking plane tickets based on user requests, picking out presents for a birthday party or planning out company hiring plans.\n\nUnfortunately, they mostly don\'t work yet for long term planning, reasoning and execution of complex tasks. We imagine AI systems that can come up with a comprehensive marketing plan for a new product, write and create the website, craft all the outreach messages, get the list of people to reach out to and then send the emails to get new customers. We are not there yet but that doesn\'t mean they won\'t at some point. With so many traditional programmers getting into machine learning and applying ideas that data scientists and data engineers wouldn\'t think of because it\'s outside their domain knowledge, we\'re seeing improvements constantly in these systems and fully autonomous Agents could be a ubiquitous facet of all our lives in the near future or over the next decade.\n\nMany of these fully autonomous projects sparked tremendous public interest. AutoGPT racked up GitHub stars faster than almost any project in history but we can no longer take GitHub stars as a true measure of software prowess. The tremendous public interest in AI, which is often driven by sci-fi novels and Hollywood blockbusters and not by the actual reality of the current state of the technology. That outside interest sometimes drives brand new projects to the Github star stratosphere, only to see actual developer interest in those projects crumble soon after. That happens when cognitive dissonance sets in and the software doesn\'t end up matching people\'s expectations of a super-intelligent software avatar, like the AI in the fantastic movie Her.\n\nStill, some of those projects continue to attract ardent followers who continue to add new capabilities, such as with BabyAGI. Not only that but reasoning and planning for Agents continues to evolve with software and research projects that incorporate new techniques to help the LLMs think better, such as Chain of Thought prompting, or giving them a history that they can recall with projects like the Generative Simulacra from a team out of Stanford, which "extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent\'s experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior."\xa0\n\nDespite all these techniques they still struggle with going off the rails and hallucinating and making major mistakes in their thinking, especially as the time horizon for independent decision making increases. Short term, on-the-rails reasoning is often sound but the longer the agents have to act and make decisions on their own the larger their chance of breaking down.\n\nEven with all these limitations and caveats, Agents have gotten more powerful. Why have Agents suddenly gotten much more powerful? The answer is simple. ChatGPT was a watershed moment in computing and AI history that shocked outsiders and insiders alike.\xa0\n\nSuddenly, we had a system that delivered realistic and free flowing conversations on any subject at any time. That\'s a radical departure from the past where chatbots were brittle and not even vaguely human. The first chatbot, ELIZA, was created in the 1960s at MIT. We\'ve had Clippy, the famous paperclip in Microsoft Office products in the late 90s and early 2000s that was notorious for being slow and virtually useless for answering any questions at all. We\'ve had Alexa and Siri which can do things like play songs or answer questions by doing lookups in a database. But none of them really worked all that well.\xa0\n\nChatGPT and GPT-4 just feel different.\xa0\n\nThat\'s because all these bots of the past were often brittle rule based systems. They were glorified scripts that triggered based on what you said or wrote. They couldn\'t adapt to you or your tone or writing style. They had no real context about the larger conversation you\'d had with them. They felt static and unintelligent. Nobody would mistake them for humans.\n\nThe architecture of GPT-4 is a secret, though we know its based on transformers. We\'d had speculation that it\'s a massive transformer with a trillion parameters of that it\'s not a big model at all but 8 smaller models, known as a Mixture of Experts (MoE), which leverages a suite of smaller expert models to do different tasks. Whatever the actual architecture of the model is, which we will only know when its architecture is officially made public, it\'s a model that\'s more powerful and capable than any other model on the market and it remains the high water mark as of the time of this writing. Even with models like Meta\'s open source marvel Llama 2 that came out a year later can\'t seem to replicate its performance, though they approach it.\xa0\n\nThat said, it\'s only a matter of time before other teams create a more powerful model. By the time you read this the arms race to create ever more powerful models by open source teams like Eleuther AI and Meta\'s AI research division, or by any of the proprietary companies piling up GPUs to build their own models, like Google, Anthropic, Cohere, Inflection, Aleph Alpha, Mistral and Adept may already have produced that model.\n\nWith more powerful software brains powering today\'s Agents, we have much more powerful systems at hand. They\'re the engine that drive Centaurs and Agents to much more useful capabilities. Unlike the relatively limited capabilities of enterprise Robotic Process Automation (RPA) of the past, that were typically limited to well defined processes and structured data, we have Agents and AI driven applications that can work in the unstructured world of websites, documents and software APIs. These Agents can summarize websites with ease, understand what\'s going on the text, offer an opinion, act as language tutors and research assistants and much, much more.\xa0\n\nIt\'s really only the beginning. ChatGPT was the starting point but not the end game. Since GPT, we\'ve had a surge of capable open source models. Hugging Face tracks them with an open suite of tests on a leaderboard for open source models. It seems like every week a new open source model takes the crown. We\'ve seen Meta\'s LLaMA and Llama 2, along with Vicuna, Orca, Falcon, not to mention specialized models like Gorilla that specializes in working with APIs.\xa0\n\nVenture capital is pouring into foundation model companies so they can spin up massive supercomputers of GPUs. OpenAI attracted over 10B USD in investments and recently Inflection AI announced 1.3B USD in funding to create a 22,000 strong Nvidia H100 cluster to train their latest models. With all that capital, OpenAI will not remain the only game in town. At the AIIA we expect a massive flurry of capable models to power the intelligence apps of today and tomorrow.\n\nAgents offer a potentially new kind of software that\'s beyond the capabilities of traditional hand coded software written by expert programmers. The power of these LLMs and the middleware that\'s rising up around them makes it possible for very small teams to build highly capable AI driven applications with one to ten people. It\'s an extension of the WhatsApp effect, where a small team of 50 developers was able to reach 300M people with their application because they were able to leverage an ever increasing stack of sophisticated pre-baked software to build their platform, everything from ready-made UIs to secure encryption libraries.\xa0\n\nThe power of LLMs, along with a suite of models that do a particular task very well, like SAM (Segment Anything Model), Stable Diffusion, Gen1 and Gen 2, coupled with a new generation of middleware is making it possible for even smaller teams to reach a wider audience. The bar to building great software has lowered again and history shows that whenever that happens we see a flurry of new applications.\n\nIt\'s also possible to build smaller, more focused apps now, like a bot that can ingest a series of legal documents and answer questions about what jurisdictions a company might face lawsuits in, an app that can research a massive amount of companies and tell you which ones are good for your marketing team to contact, or an app that can ingest news articles, write summaries of them and create a newsletter. Stacking these agents together holds the potential of creating intelligent microservices that can deliver new kinds of functionality.\xa0\n\nWith state of the art LLMs behind the scenes that are broadly capable and able to power agents whose sensory input from keystrokes, web pages, code, external models and knowledge repositories, we now have Agents that can do things we only saw in the movies, like automatically upscale photos and add detail to them that was hidden or missing, reason about what is on a web page or in a PDF document and make complex decisions. An old writer\'s trope in every detective show is where the cops find some grainy VHS footage and their computer team ‘enhances\' that footage to get the next big clue in the case. That was basically impossible but now we have systems that are a lot like the Bladerunner scene where Detective Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, takes an old photo, puts it into an analysis machine, talks to the machine and tells it what to do, and the machine enhances the photo to bring out hidden spots.\n\nWe\'ve gone from only robotics researchers and data scientists building Agents, to traditional programmers building Agents to do complex tasks that were impossible only a short time again with hand written code and heuristics.\xa0\n\nBut despite all these amazing new capabilities none of this is without its challenges. LLMs are non-deterministic systems and they don\'t always behave or act in a way that\'s predictable. A traditional hand written piece of software can only fail in so many ways. If we have a subroutine that logs a user into a website there are only so many ways it can go wrong. But LLMs and other models can produce wildly unpredictable results from task to task. A diffusion model like Stable Diffusion XL might excel at creating photorealistic portraits but fail miserably at making a cartoon style painting of a cute robot. Even worse, because these systems are so open ended, there is no real way to test all of the possibilities that someone might use them for on a given day. One user might ask the LLM simple questions about how to make a good dinner for their wife, while another might try to trick it into revealing security information, while still another might ask it to do complex math.\n\nWrangling these systems to create useful software is an ongoing challenge. So lets dive in and look at the promises and perils of LLMs, Generative AI and Agents for both small business and enterprises. We\'ll start with the new emerging stack that\'s enabling people to create these applications and then move on to challenges every company or person looking to adopt or build these systems will face.\n\nKEY CHARTS\n\nWe’ve discovered that the teams surveyed often faced their biggest challenges with collecting the data they need along with cleaning, QAing and transforming that data, which falls squarely on the shoulders of data engineers.\n\nThat’s reflected in the composition of teams as well. Most companies surveyed employed more data engineers than data scientists. It’s also reflected in where teams are spending the most time and money.\n\nOnly 26% of teams we surveyed were very satisfied with their current AI/ML infrastructure. 55% percent were only somewhat satisfied, while 17% were somewhat unsatisfied, and 3% were very unsatisfied. In other words, most teams see a lot of room for improvement.\n\n\xa0\n\nThis is the information we needed to make much better decisions about what\'s out there and what\'s ready for prime time in machine learning infrastructure.\n\nFortune 500 Chief of Artificial Intelligence\n\n\t\nGET IT NOW!\n\nAnd start planning for the future, today.\n\nDownload Now\n'}]

Artificial Intelligence/AI Agents and their Environments
< Artificial Intelligence
Jump to navigation
Jump to search

Particular artificial intelligence programs, or AIs, can be thought of as intelligent "agents" that interact with particular environments. In general, intelligent agents of all types (including rats, people, as well as AI programs) interact with their environments in two main ways: perception and action.

For purposes of AI, perception is the process of transforming something from the environment into internal representations (memories, beliefs, etc.). Action done when the agent, by doing something, changes the environment.

For example, if a robot uses its camera to determine that there is a wall in front of it, then it is using perception. In this example, the camera is a "sensor." In general, sensors are what agents use to get things from the environment to do perception. Human sensors include eyes, ears, and the nose. AIs can have sensors of many types, including ones analogous to human perception, but also including some that humans do not have, such as sonar, infrared, GPS signals, etc.

If that robot uses its body to push the wall over, then it is doing action. The body, in this case, is an "actuator". If the robot uses wheels to back up, this is also an example of doing action. The environment has changed because the robot is now in a different place. Typical robot actuators include arms, wheels, lights, or speakers.




What about an AI that has no body? Let's take, for example, a music recommendation system. In this case, the environment for the agent might be the web page that the user clicks and types into, or perhaps a database of user preferences. The sensors, in this case, are abstract functions in the agent's programming, rather than pieces of hardware, as they are on a robot. The function that detects when a user clicks, or the function that fetches information from the database might be considered sensors for this agent. What would the actuators be? When the agent displays recommended music to the user, they are using actuators to display things on the screen--or to serve the web page. Another example is the database that the music recommendation system uses--should it be considered a part of the environment that the agent interacts with, or a part of the agent's memory? As you can see from this example, what is considered an actuator and what is considered part of the environment depends on what you consider to be the boundaries of the agent. There is not always a right or wrong boundary. It depends on the context of the discussion.

Environment Classification System

In spite of the difficulty of knowing exactly where the environment ends and the agent begins in some cases, it is useful to be able to classify AI environments because it can predict how difficult the task of the AI will be. Russell and Norvig (2009) introduce seven ways to classify AI environments, which can be remembered with the mnemonic "D-SOAKED." They are:

Deterministicness (deterministic or stochastic or Non-deterministic): An environment is deterministic if the next state is perfectly predictable given knowledge of the previous state and the agent's action.
Staticness (static or dynamic): Static environments do not change while the agent deliberates.
Observability (full or partial): A fully observable environment is one in which the agent has access to all information in the environment relevant to its task.
Agency (single or multiple): If there is at least one other agent in the environment, it is a multi-agent environment. Other agents might be apathetic, cooperative, or competitive.
Knowledge (known or unknown): An environment is considered to be "known" if the agent understands the laws that govern the environment's behavior. For example, in chess, the agent would know that when a piece is "taken" it is removed from the game. On a street, the agent might know that when it rains, the streets get slippery.
Episodicness (episodic or sequential): Sequential environments require memory of past actions to determine the next best action. Episodic environments are a series of one-shot actions, and only the current (or recent) percept is relevant. An AI that looks at radiology images to determine if there is a sickness is an example of an episodic environment. One image has nothing to do with the next.
Discreteness (discrete or continuous): A discrete environment has fixed locations or time intervals. A continuous environment could be measured quantitatively to any level of precision.

In each case, the job of the AI (and for the programmer making the AI) is easier if the first of the two options is the best descriptor for each category. That is, an AI has a much more difficult job if it works in an environment that is stochastic, dynamic, partially observable, multi-agent, unknown, sequential, and continuous.


High-Level Descriptions of AI Agents

AIs are made in a variety of ways. When communicating about a new AI, perhaps in a scholarly paper, or perhaps at a business meeting, there are a few questions that can be asked of just about any AI. These can be remembered with the mnemonic PEAS.

Performance Metrics: How does the AI know it's doing what it's supposed to be doing?
Environment: What environment does the agent interact with?
Actuators: How does the AI affect its environment?
Sensors: How does the AI get information from its environment?

Important vocabulary:

perception
action
sensor
actuator
environment
performance metric
deterministic
stochastic
fully observable
partially observable
dynamic environment
static environment
multi-agent environment
known and unknown environments
Episodic environment
Sequential environment
discrete vs. continuous environments

Discussion Question:

Using the classification schemes described above (PEAS, D-SOAKED), describe the following AI agents: a self-driving car, a face-recognition system at an airport, a scheduling system for a trucking business, R2D2.

Underlying Technologies

In the last five years, the field of AI has made major progress in almost all its standard sub-areas, including vision, speech recognition and generation, natural language processing (understanding and generation), image and video generation, multi-agent systems, planning, decision-making, and integration of vision and motor control for robotics. In addition, breakthrough applications emerged in a variety of domains including games, medical diagnosis, logistics systems, autonomous driving, language translation, and interactive personal assistance. The sections that follow provide examples of many salient developments.

People are using AI more today to dictate to their phone, get recommendations for shopping, news, or entertainment, enhance their backgrounds on conference calls, and so much more. The core technology behind most of the most visible advances is machine learning, especially deep learning (including generative adversarial networks or GANs) and reinforcement learning powered by large-scale data and computing resources. GANs are a major breakthrough, endowing deep networks with the ability to produce artificial content such as fake images that pass for the real thing. GANs consist of two interlocked components—a generator, responsible for creating realistic content, and a discriminator, tasked with distinguishing the output of the generator from naturally occurring content. The two learn from each other, becoming better and better at their respective tasks over time. One of the practical applications can be seen in GAN-based medical-image augmentation, in which artificial images are produced automatically to expand the data set used to train networks for producing diagnoses1. Recognition of the remarkable power of deep learning has been steadily growing over the last decade. Recent studies have begun to uncover why and under what conditions deep learning works well2. In the past ten years, machine-learning technologies have moved from the academic realm into the real world in a multitude of ways that are both promising and concerning.

Language Processing

Language processing technology made a major leap in the last five years, leading to the development of network architectures with enhanced capability to learn from complex and context-sensitive data. These advances have been supported by ever-increasing data resources and computing power.

Of particular note are neural network language models, including ELMo, GPT, mT5, and BERT.3 These models learn about how words are used in context—including elements of grammar, meaning, and basic facts about the world—from sifting through the patterns in naturally occurring text. They consist of billions of tunable parameters and are engineered to be able to process unprecedented quantities of data (over one trillion words for GPT-3, for example). By stringing together likely sequences of words, several of these models can generate passages of text that are often indistinguishable from human-generated text, including news stories, poems, fiction and even computer code. Performance on question-answering benchmarks (large quizzes with questions like “Where was Beyoncé born?”) have reached superhuman levels,4 although the models that achieve this level of proficiency exploit spurious correlations in the benchmarks and exhibit a level of competence on naturally occurring questions that is still well below that of human beings.

These models’ facility with language is already supporting applications such as machine translation, text classification, speech recognition, writing aids, and chatbots. Future applications could include improving human-AI interactions across diverse languages and situations. Current challenges include how to obtain quality data for languages used by smaller populations, and how to detect and remove biases in their behavior. In addition, it is worth noting that the models themselves do not exhibit deep understanding of the texts that they process, fundamentally limiting their utility in many sensitive applications. Part of the art of using these models, to date, is in finding scenarios where their incomplete mastery still provides value.

Related to language processing is the tremendous growth in conversational interfaces over the past five years. The near ubiquity of voice-control systems like Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa is a consequence of both improvements on the voice-recognition side, powered by the AI advances discussed above, and also improvements in how information is organized and integrated for voice-based delivery. Google Duplex, a conversational interface that can call businesses to make restaurant reservations and appointments, was rolled out in 2018 and received mixed initial reviews due to its impressive engineering but off-putting system design.5

Computer Vision and Image Processing

Image-processing technology is now widespread, finding uses ranging from video-conference backgrounds to the photo-realistic images known as deepfakes. Many image-processing approaches use deep learning for recognition, classification, conversion, and other tasks. Training time for image processing has been substantially reduced. Programs running on ImageNet, a massive standardized collection of over 14 million photographs used to train and test visual identification programs, complete their work 100 times faster than just three years ago.6

Real-time object-detection systems such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) that notice important objects when they appear in an image are widely used for video surveillance of crowds and are important for mobile robots including self-driving cars. Face-recognition technology has also improved significantly over the last five years, and now some smartphones and even office buildings rely on it to control access. In China, facial-recognition technology is used widely in society, from security to payment, although there are very recent moves to pull back on the broad deployment of this technology.7 Of course, while facial-recognition technology can be a powerful tool to improve efficiency and safety, it raises issues around bias and privacy. Some companies have suspended providing face-recognition services. And, in fact, the creator of YOLO has said that he no longer works on the technology because “the military applications and privacy concerns became impossible to ignore.”8

It is now possible to generate photorealistic images and even videos using GANs. Sophisticated image-processing systems enhanced by deep learning let users seamlessly replace existing images with new ones, such as inserting someone into a video of an event they did not attend. While such modifications could be carried out by skilled artists decades ago, AI automation has substantially lowered the barriers. These so-called deepfakes are being used in illicit activity such as “revenge porn,” in which an attacker creates artificial sexual content featuring a specific victim, and identity theft, in which a profile of a non-existent person is generated and used to gain access to services, and have spurred research into improving automatic detection of deepfake images.

Caption: The GAN technology for generating images and the transformer technology for producing text can be integrated in various ways. These images were produced by OpenAI’s “DALL-E” given the prompt: “a stained glass window with an image of a blue strawberry.” A similar query to a web-based image search produces blue strawberries, blue stained-glass windows, or stained-glass windows with red strawberries, suggesting that the system is not merely retrieving relevant images but producing novel combinations of visual features.

Games

Developing algorithms for games and simulations in adversarial situations has long been a fertile training ground and a showcase for the advancement of AI techniques. DeepMind’s application of deep networks to Atari video games and the game of Go around 2015 helped bring deep learning to wide public prominence, and the last five years have seen significant additional progress. AI agents have now out-maneuvered their human counterparts in combat and multiplayer situations including the games StarCraft II,9 Quake III,10 and Alpha Dogfight11—a US Defense Department-sponsored jet-fighter simulation—as well as classical games like poker.12

The DeepMind team that developed AlphaGo went on to create AlphaGoZero,13 which discarded the use of direct human guidance in the form of a large collection of data from past Go matches. Instead, it developed moves and tactics on its own, starting from scratch. This idea was further augmented with AlphaZero,14 a single network architecture that could learn to play expert-level Go, Shogi, or Chess.

Robotics

The last five years have seen consistent progress in intelligent robotics driven by machine learning, powerful computing and communication capabilities, and increased availability of sophisticated sensor systems. Although these systems are not fully able to take advantage of all the advances in AI, primarily due to the physical constraints of the environments, highly agile and dynamic robotics systems are now available for home and industrial use. In industrial robotics, with the implementation of deep-learning-based vision systems, manipulator-type robots—those that grab things, as opposed to those that roll across the floor—can pick up randomly placed overlapping objects at speeds that are practical for real-world applications.

Bipedal and four-legged robots continue to advance in agility. Atlas, a state-of-the-art humanoid robot built by Boston Dynamics, demonstrated the ability to jump, run, backflip, and maneuver uneven terrain—feats that were impossible for robots just a few years ago. Spot, a quadruped robot also from Boston Dynamics,15 also maneuvers through difficult environments and is being used on construction sites for delivery and monitoring of lightweight materials and tools. It is worth noting, however, that these systems are built using a combination of learning techniques honed in the last several years, classical control theory akin to that used in autopilots, and painstaking engineering and design. Cassie, a biped robot developed by Agility Robotics and Oregon State University, uses deep reinforcement learning for its walking and running behaviors.16 Whereas deployment of AI in user-facing vision and language technologies is now commonplace, the majority of types of robotics systems remain lab-bound.

During 2020, robotics development was driven in part by the need to support social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. A group of restaurants opened in China staffed by a team of 20 robots to help cook and serve food. Some early delivery robots were deployed on controlled campuses18 to carry books and food. A diverse collection of companies worldwide are actively pursuing business opportunities in autonomous delivery systems for the last mile. While these types of robots are being increasingly used in the real world, they are by no means mainstream yet and are still prone to mistakes, especially when deployed in unmapped or novel environments. In Japan, a new legal framework is being discussed to ensure that autonomous robotics systems are able to be safely deployed on public roads at limited speeds.19

The combination of deep learning with agile robotics is opening up new opportunities in industrial robotics as well. Leveraging improvements in vision, robotic grippers are beginning to be able to select and pick randomly placed objects and use them to construct stacks. Being able to pick up and put down diverse objects is a key competence in a variety of potential applications, from tidying up homes to preparing packages for shipping.

Mobility

Autonomous vehicles or self-driving cars have been one of the hottest areas in deployed robotics, as they impact the entire automobile industry as well as city planning. The design of self-driving cars requires integration of a range of technologies including sensor fusion, AI planning and decision-making, vehicle dynamics prediction, on-the-fly rerouting, inter-vehicle communication, and more. Driver assist systems are increasingly widespread in production vehicles.20 These systems use sensors and AI-based analysis to carry out tasks such as adaptive cruise control to safely adjust speed, and lane-keeping assistance to keep vehicles centered on the road.

The optimistic predictions from five years ago of rapid progress in fully autonomous driving have failed to materialize. The reasons may be complicated,21 but the need for exceptional levels of safety in complex physical environments makes the problem more challenging, and more expensive, to solve than had been anticipated. Nevertheless, autonomous vehicles are now operating in certain locales such as Phoenix, Arizona, where driving and weather conditions are particularly benign, and outside Beijing, where 5G connectivity allows remote drivers to take over if needed.22

Health

AI is increasingly being used in biomedical applications, particularly in diagnosis, drug discovery, and basic life science research.

Recent years have seen AI-based imaging technologies move from an academic pursuit to commercial projects.23 Tools now exist for identifying a variety of eye and skin disorders,24 detecting cancers,25 and supporting measurements needed for clinical diagnosis.26 Some of these systems rival the diagnostic abilities of expert pathologists and radiologists, and can help alleviate tedious tasks (for example, counting the number of cells dividing in cancer tissue). In other domains, however, the use of automated systems raises significant ethical concerns.27

AI-based risk scoring in healthcare is also becoming more common. Predictors of health deterioration are now integrated into major health record platforms (for example, EPIC Deterioration Index), and individual health centers are increasingly integrating AI-based risk predictions into their operations.28 Although some amount of bias is evident in these systems,29 they appear exceptionally promising for overall improvements in healthcare.

Beyond treatment support, AI now augments a number of other health operations and measurements, such as helping predict durations of surgeries to optimize scheduling, and  identifying patients at risk of needing transfer to intensive care.30 There are technologies for digital medical transcription,31 for reading ECG systems, for producing super-resolution images to reduce the amount of time patients are in MRI machines, and for identifying questions for clinicians to ask pediatric patients.32 While current penetration is relatively low, we can expect to see uses of AI expand in this domain in the future; in many cases, these are applications of already-mature technologies in other areas of operations making their way into healthcare.

Finance

AI has been increasingly adopted into finance. Deep learning models now partially automate lending decisions for several lenders33 and have transformed payments with credit scoring, for example WeChat Pay.34 These new systems often take advantage of consumer data that are not traditionally used in credit scoring. In some cases, this approach can open up credit to new groups of people; in others, it can be used to force people to adopt specific social behaviors.35

High-frequency trading relies on a combination of models as well as the ability to make fast decisions. In the space of personal finance, so-called robo-advising—automated financial advice—is quickly becoming mainstream for investment and overall financial planning.36  For financial institutions, uses of AI are going beyond detecting fraud and enhancing cybersecurity to automating legal and compliance documentation as well as detecting money laundering.37 Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) of Japan, the world’s largest pension fund, introduced a deep-learning-based system to monitor investment styles of contracting fund managers and identify risk from unexpected change in market situations known as regime switch.38 Such applications enable financial institutions to recognize otherwise invisible risks, contributing to more robust and stable asset-management practices. 

Recommender Systems

With the explosion of information available to us, recommender systems that automatically prioritize what we see when we are online have become absolutely essential. Such systems have always drawn heavily on AI, and now they have a dramatic influence on people’s consumption of products, services, and content—from news, to music, to videos, and more. Apart from a general trend toward more online activity and commerce, the AI technologies powering recommender systems have changed considerably in the past five years. One shift is the near-universal incorporation of deep neural networks to better predict user responses to recommendations.39 There has also been increased usage of sophisticated machine-learning techniques for analyzing the content of recommended items, rather than using only meta-data and user click or consumption behavior. That is, AI systems are making more of an effort to understand why a specific item might be a good recommendation for a particular person or query. Examples include Spotify’s use of audio analysis of music40 or the application of large language models such as BERT to improve recommendations of news or social media posts.41 Another trend is modeling and prediction of multiple distinct user behaviors, instead of making recommendations for only one activity at a time; functionality facilitated by the use of so-called multi-task models.42 Of course, applying recommendation to multiple tasks simultaneously raises the challenging question of how best to make tradeoffs among these different objectives.

The use of ever-more-sophisticated machine-learned models for recommending products, services, and (especially) content has raised significant concerns about the issues of fairness, diversity, polarization, and the emergence of filter bubbles, where the recommender system suggests, for example, news stories that other people like you are reading instead of what is truly most important. While these problems require more than just technical solutions, increasing attention is paid to technologies that can at least partly address such issues. Promising directions include research on the tradeoffs between popularity and diversity of content consumption,43 and fairness of recommendations among different users and other stakeholders (such as the content providers or creators).44

We\'re looking forward to your contributions.\nArtificial Intelligence/AI Agents and their Environments\n< Artificial Intelligence\nJump to navigation\nJump to search\n\nParticular artificial intelligence programs, or AIs, can be thought of as intelligent "agents" that interact with particular environments. In general, intelligent agents of all types (including rats, people, as well as AI programs) interact with their environments in two main ways: perception and action.\n\nFor purposes of AI, perception is the process of transforming something from the environment into internal representations (memories, beliefs, etc.). Action done when the agent, by doing something, changes the environment.\n\nFor example, if a robot uses its camera to determine that there is a wall in front of it, then it is using perception. In this example, the camera is a "sensor." In general, sensors are what agents use to get things from the environment to do perception. Human sensors include eyes, ears, and the nose. AIs can have sensors of many types, including ones analogous to human perception, but also including some that humans do not have, such as sonar, infrared, GPS signals, etc.\n\nIf that robot uses its body to push the wall over, then it is doing action. The body, in this case, is an "actuator". If the robot uses wheels to back up, this is also an example of doing action. The environment has changed because the robot is now in a different place. Typical robot actuators include arms, wheels, lights, or speakers.\n\n\n\n\nWhat about an AI that has no body? Let\'s take, for example, a music recommendation system. In this case, the environment for the agent might be the web page that the user clicks and types into, or perhaps a database of user preferences. The sensors, in this case, are abstract functions in the agent\'s programming, rather than pieces of hardware, as they are on a robot. The function that detects when a user clicks, or the function that fetches information from the database might be considered sensors for this agent. What would the actuators be? When the agent displays recommended music to the user, they are using actuators to display things on the screen--or to serve the web page. Another example is the database that the music recommendation system uses--should it be considered a part of the environment that the agent interacts with, or a part of the agent\'s memory? As you can see from this example, what is considered an actuator and what is considered part of the environment depends on what you consider to be the boundaries of the agent. There is not always a right or wrong boundary. It depends on the context of the discussion.\n\nEnvironment Classification System\n\nIn spite of the difficulty of knowing exactly where the environment ends and the agent begins in some cases, it is useful to be able to classify AI environments because it can predict how difficult the task of the AI will be. Russell and Norvig (2009) introduce seven ways to classify AI environments, which can be remembered with the mnemonic "D-SOAKED." They are:\n\nDeterministicness (deterministic or stochastic or Non-deterministic): An environment is deterministic if the next state is perfectly predictable given knowledge of the previous state and the agent\'s action.\nStaticness (static or dynamic): Static environments do not change while the agent deliberates.\nObservability (full or partial): A fully observable environment is one in which the agent has access to all information in the environment relevant to its task.\nAgency (single or multiple): If there is at least one other agent in the environment, it is a multi-agent environment. Other agents might be apathetic, cooperative, or competitive.\nKnowledge (known or unknown): An environment is considered to be "known" if the agent understands the laws that govern the environment\'s behavior. For example, in chess, the agent would know that when a piece is "taken" it is removed from the game. On a street, the agent might know that when it rains, the streets get slippery.\nEpisodicness (episodic or sequential): Sequential environments require memory of past actions to determine the next best action. Episodic environments are a series of one-shot actions, and only the current (or recent) percept is relevant. An AI that looks at radiology images to determine if there is a sickness is an example of an episodic environment. One image has nothing to do with the next.\nDiscreteness (discrete or continuous): A discrete environment has fixed locations or time intervals. A continuous environment could be measured quantitatively to any level of precision.\n\nIn each case, the job of the AI (and for the programmer making the AI) is easier if the first of the two options is the best descriptor for each category. That is, an AI has a much more difficult job if it works in an environment that is stochastic, dynamic, partially observable, multi-agent, unknown, sequential, and continuous.\n\n\nHigh-Level Descriptions of AI Agents\n\nAIs are made in a variety of ways. When communicating about a new AI, perhaps in a scholarly paper, or perhaps at a business meeting, there are a few questions that can be asked of just about any AI. These can be remembered with the mnemonic PEAS.\n\nPerformance Metrics: How does the AI know it\'s doing what it\'s supposed to be doing?\nEnvironment: What environment does the agent interact with?\nActuators: How does the AI affect its environment?\nSensors: How does the AI get information from its environment?\n\nImportant vocabulary:\n\nperception\naction\nsensor\nactuator\nenvironment\nperformance metric\ndeterministic\nstochastic\nfully observable\npartially observable\ndynamic environment\nstatic environment\nmulti-agent environment\nknown and unknown environments\nEpisodic environment\nSequential environment\ndiscrete vs. continuous environments\n\nDiscussion Question:\n\nUsing the classification schemes described above (PEAS, D-SOAKED), describe the following AI agents: a self-driving car, a face-recognition system at an airport, a scheduling system for a trucking business, R2D2.\n\nReferences:\n\nRussell, S. & Norvig, S.

In addition, breakthrough applications emerged in a variety of domains including games, medical diagnosis, logistics systems, autonomous driving, language translation, and interactive personal assistance. The sections that follow provide examples of many salient developments.\n\nPeople are using AI more today to dictate to their phone, get recommendations for shopping, news, or entertainment, enhance their backgrounds on conference calls, and so much more. The core technology behind most of the most visible advances is machine learning, especially deep learning (including generative adversarial networks or GANs) and reinforcement learning powered by large-scale data and computing resources. GANs are a major breakthrough, endowing deep networks with the ability to produce artificial content such as fake images that pass for the real thing. GANs consist of two interlocked components—a generator, responsible for creating realistic content, and a discriminator, tasked with distinguishing the output of the generator from naturally occurring content. The two learn from each other, becoming better and better at their respective tasks over time. One of the practical applications can be seen in GAN-based medical-image augmentation, in which artificial images are produced automatically to expand the data set used to train networks for producing diagnoses1. Recognition of the remarkable power of deep learning has been steadily growing over the last decade. Recent studies have begun to uncover why and under what conditions deep learning works well2. In the past ten years, machine-learning technologies have moved from the academic realm into the real world in a multitude of ways that are both promising and concerning.\n\nLanguage Processing\n\nLanguage processing technology made a major leap in the last five years, leading to the development of network architectures with enhanced capability to learn from complex and context-sensitive data. These advances have been supported by ever-increasing data resources and computing power.\n\nOf particular note are neural network language models, including ELMo, GPT, mT5, and BERT.3 These models learn about how words are used in context—including elements of grammar, meaning, and basic facts about the world—from sifting through the patterns in naturally occurring text. They consist of billions of tunable parameters and are engineered to be able to process unprecedented quantities of data (over one trillion words for GPT-3, for example). By stringing together likely sequences of words, several of these models can generate passages of text that are often indistinguishable from human-generated text, including news stories, poems, fiction and even computer code. Performance on question-answering benchmarks (large quizzes with questions like “Where was Beyoncé born?”) have reached superhuman levels,4 although the models that achieve this level of proficiency exploit spurious correlations in the benchmarks and exhibit a level of competence on naturally occurring questions that is still well below that of human beings.\n\nThese models’ facility with language is already supporting applications such as machine translation, text classification, speech recognition, writing aids, and chatbots. Future applications could include improving human-AI interactions across diverse languages and situations. Current challenges include how to obtain quality data for languages used by smaller populations, and how to detect and remove biases in their behavior. In addition, it is worth noting that the models themselves do not exhibit deep understanding of the texts that they process, fundamentally limiting their utility in many sensitive applications. Part of the art of using these models, to date, is in finding scenarios where their incomplete mastery still provides value.\n\nRelated to language processing is the tremendous growth in conversational interfaces over the past five years. The near ubiquity of voice-control systems like Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa is a consequence of both improvements on the voice-recognition side, powered by the AI advances discussed above, and also improvements in how information is organized and integrated for voice-based delivery. Google Duplex, a conversational interface that can call businesses to make restaurant reservations and appointments, was rolled out in 2018 and received mixed initial reviews due to its impressive engineering but off-putting system design.5\n\nComputer Vision and Image Processing\n\nImage-processing technology is now widespread, finding uses ranging from video-conference backgrounds to the photo-realistic images known as deepfakes. Many image-processing approaches use deep learning for recognition, classification, conversion, and other tasks. Training time for image processing has been substantially reduced. Programs running on ImageNet, a massive standardized collection of over 14 million photographs used to train and test visual identification programs, complete their work 100 times faster than just three years ago.6\n\nReal-time object-detection systems such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) that notice important objects when they appear in an image are widely used for video surveillance of crowds and are important for mobile robots including self-driving cars. Face-recognition technology has also improved significantly over the last five years, and now some smartphones and even office buildings rely on it to control access. In China, facial-recognition technology is used widely in society, from security to payment, although there are very recent moves to pull back on the broad deployment of this technology.7 Of course, while facial-recognition technology can be a powerful tool to improve efficiency and safety, it raises issues around bias and privacy. Some companies have suspended providing face-recognition services. And, in fact, the creator of YOLO has said that he no longer works on the technology because “the military applications and privacy concerns became impossible to ignore.”8\n\nIt is now possible to generate photorealistic images and even videos using GANs. Sophisticated image-processing systems enhanced by deep learning let users seamlessly replace existing images with new ones, such as inserting someone into a video of an event they did not attend. While such modifications could be carried out by skilled artists decades ago, AI automation has substantially lowered the barriers. These so-called deepfakes are being used in illicit activity such as “revenge porn,” in which an attacker creates artificial sexual content featuring a specific victim, and identity theft, in which a profile of a non-existent person is generated and used to gain access to services, and have spurred research into improving automatic detection of deepfake images.\n\nCaption: The GAN technology for generating images and the transformer technology for producing text can be integrated in various ways. These images were produced by OpenAI’s “DALL-E” given the prompt: “a stained glass window with an image of a blue strawberry.” A similar query to a web-based image search produces blue strawberries, blue stained-glass windows, or stained-glass windows with red strawberries, suggesting that the system is not merely retrieving relevant images but producing novel combinations of visual features. From: https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/\nGames\n\nDeveloping algorithms for games and simulations in adversarial situations has long been a fertile training ground and a showcase for the advancement of AI techniques. DeepMind’s application of deep networks to Atari video games and the game of Go around 2015 helped bring deep learning to wide public prominence, and the last five years have seen significant additional progress. AI agents have now out-maneuvered their human counterparts in combat and multiplayer situations including the games StarCraft II,9 Quake III,10 and Alpha Dogfight11—a US Defense Department-sponsored jet-fighter simulation—as well as classical games like poker.12\n\nThe DeepMind team that developed AlphaGo went on to create AlphaGoZero,13 which discarded the use of direct human guidance in the form of a large collection of data from past Go matches. Instead, it developed moves and tactics on its own, starting from scratch. This idea was further augmented with AlphaZero,14 a single network architecture that could learn to play expert-level Go, Shogi, or Chess.\n\nRobotics\n\nThe last five years have seen consistent progress in intelligent robotics driven by machine learning, powerful computing and communication capabilities, and increased availability of sophisticated sensor systems. Although these systems are not fully able to take advantage of all the advances in AI, primarily due to the physical constraints of the environments, highly agile and dynamic robotics systems are now available for home and industrial use. In industrial robotics, with the implementation of deep-learning-based vision systems, manipulator-type robots—those that grab things, as opposed to those that roll across the floor—can pick up randomly placed overlapping objects at speeds that are practical for real-world applications.\n\nBipedal and four-legged robots continue to advance in agility. Atlas, a state-of-the-art humanoid robot built by Boston Dynamics, demonstrated the ability to jump, run, backflip, and maneuver uneven terrain—feats that were impossible for robots just a few years ago. Spot, a quadruped robot also from Boston Dynamics,15 also maneuvers through difficult environments and is being used on construction sites for delivery and monitoring of lightweight materials and tools. It is worth noting, however, that these systems are built using a combination of learning techniques honed in the last several years, classical control theory akin to that used in autopilots, and painstaking engineering and design. Cassie, a biped robot developed by Agility Robotics and Oregon State University, uses deep reinforcement learning for its walking and running behaviors.16 Whereas deployment of AI in user-facing vision and language technologies is now commonplace, the majority of types of robotics systems remain lab-bound.\n\nDuring 2020, robotics development was driven in part by the need to support social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. A group of restaurants opened in China staffed by a team of 20 robots to help cook and serve food. Some early delivery robots were deployed on controlled campuses18 to carry books and food. A diverse collection of companies worldwide are actively pursuing business opportunities in autonomous delivery systems for the last mile. While these types of robots are being increasingly used in the real world, they are by no means mainstream yet and are still prone to mistakes, especially when deployed in unmapped or novel environments. In Japan, a new legal framework is being discussed to ensure that autonomous robotics systems are able to be safely deployed on public roads at limited speeds.19\n\nThe combination of deep learning with agile robotics is opening up new opportunities in industrial robotics as well. Leveraging improvements in vision, robotic grippers are beginning to be able to select and pick randomly placed objects and use them to construct stacks. Being able to pick up and put down diverse objects is a key competence in a variety of potential applications, from tidying up homes to preparing packages for shipping.\n\nMobility\n\nAutonomous vehicles or self-driving cars have been one of the hottest areas in deployed robotics, as they impact the entire automobile industry as well as city planning. The design of self-driving cars requires integration of a range of technologies including sensor fusion, AI planning and decision-making, vehicle dynamics prediction, on-the-fly rerouting, inter-vehicle communication, and more. Driver assist systems are increasingly widespread in production vehicles.20 These systems use sensors and AI-based analysis to carry out tasks such as adaptive cruise control to safely adjust speed, and lane-keeping assistance to keep vehicles centered on the road.\n\nThe optimistic predictions from five years ago of rapid progress in fully autonomous driving have failed to materialize. The reasons may be complicated,21 but the need for exceptional levels of safety in complex physical environments makes the problem more challenging, and more expensive, to solve than had been anticipated. Nevertheless, autonomous vehicles are now operating in certain locales such as Phoenix, Arizona, where driving and weather conditions are particularly benign, and outside Beijing, where 5G connectivity allows remote drivers to take over if needed.22\n\nHealth\n\nAI is increasingly being used in biomedical applications, particularly in diagnosis, drug discovery, and basic life science research.\n\nRecent years have seen AI-based imaging technologies move from an academic pursuit to commercial projects.23 Tools now exist for identifying a variety of eye and skin disorders,24 detecting cancers,25 and supporting measurements needed for clinical diagnosis.26 Some of these systems rival the diagnostic abilities of expert pathologists and radiologists, and can help alleviate tedious tasks (for example, counting the number of cells dividing in cancer tissue). In other domains, however, the use of automated systems raises significant ethical concerns.27\n\nAI-based risk scoring in healthcare is also becoming more common. Predictors of health deterioration are now integrated into major health record platforms (for example, EPIC Deterioration Index), and individual health centers are increasingly integrating AI-based risk predictions into their operations.28 Although some amount of bias is evident in these systems,29 they appear exceptionally promising for overall improvements in healthcare.\n\nBeyond treatment support, AI now augments a number of other health operations and measurements, such as helping predict durations of surgeries to optimize scheduling, and\xa0 identifying patients at risk of needing transfer to intensive care.30 There are technologies for digital medical transcription,31 for reading ECG systems, for producing super-resolution images to reduce the amount of time patients are in MRI machines, and for identifying questions for clinicians to ask pediatric patients.32 While current penetration is relatively low, we can expect to see uses of AI expand in this domain in the future; in many cases, these are applications of already-mature technologies in other areas of operations making their way into healthcare.\n\nFinance\n\nAI has been increasingly adopted into finance. Deep learning models now partially automate lending decisions for several lenders33 and have transformed payments with credit scoring, for example WeChat Pay.34 These new systems often take advantage of consumer data that are not traditionally used in credit scoring. In some cases, this approach can open up credit to new groups of people; in others, it can be used to force people to adopt specific social behaviors.35\n\nHigh-frequency trading relies on a combination of models as well as the ability to make fast decisions. In the space of personal finance, so-called robo-advising—automated financial advice—is quickly becoming mainstream for investment and overall financial planning.36\xa0 For financial institutions, uses of AI are going beyond detecting fraud and enhancing cybersecurity to automating legal and compliance documentation as well as detecting money laundering.37 Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) of Japan, the world’s largest pension fund, introduced a deep-learning-based system to monitor investment styles of contracting fund managers and identify risk from unexpected change in market situations known as regime switch.38 Such applications enable financial institutions to recognize otherwise invisible risks, contributing to more robust and stable asset-management practices.\xa0\n\nRecommender Systems\n\nWith the explosion of information available to us, recommender systems that automatically prioritize what we see when we are online have become absolutely essential. Such systems have always drawn heavily on AI, and now they have a dramatic influence on people’s consumption of products, services, and content—from news, to music, to videos, and more. Apart from a general trend toward more online activity and commerce, the AI technologies powering recommender systems have changed considerably in the past five years. One shift is the near-universal incorporation of deep neural networks to better predict user responses to recommendations.39 There has also been increased usage of sophisticated machine-learning techniques for analyzing the content of recommended items, rather than using only meta-data and user click or consumption behavior. That is, AI systems are making more of an effort to understand why a specific item might be a good recommendation for a particular person or query. Examples include Spotify’s use of audio analysis of music40 or the application of large language models such as BERT to improve recommendations of news or social media posts.41 Another trend is modeling and prediction of multiple distinct user behaviors, instead of making recommendations for only one activity at a time; functionality facilitated by the use of so-called multi-task models.42 Of course, applying recommendation to multiple tasks simultaneously raises the challenging question of how best to make tradeoffs among these different objectives.\n\nThe use of ever-more-sophisticated machine-learned models for recommending products, services, and (especially) content has raised significant concerns about the issues of fairness, diversity, polarization, and the emergence of filter bubbles, where the recommender system suggests, for example, news stories that other people like you are reading instead of what is truly most important. While these problems require more than just technical solutions, increasing attention is paid to technologies that can at least partly address such issues. Promising directions include research on the tradeoffs between popularity and diversity of content consumption,43 and fairness of recommendations among different users and other stakeholders (such as the content providers or creators).44\n\n[1]\xa0Antreas Antoniou, Amos Storkey, and Harrison Edwards, "Data Augmentation Generative Adversarial Networks," March 2018 https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04340v3\n\n[2]\xa0Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Yuanzhi Li, and Zhao Song, "A Convergence Theory for Deep Learning via Over-Parameterization," June 2019 https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03962v5\n; Chiyuan Zhang, Samy Bengio, Moritz Hardt, Benjamin Recht, and Oriol Vinyals, "Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization," February 2017 https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530v2\n\n[3] Matthew E.
