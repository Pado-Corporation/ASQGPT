What is an AI agent?

An AI agent is a system that can perceive its environment, act upon it, and achieve some goals. It can be either reactive, meaning it responds to stimuli without memory or planning, or proactive, meaning it has some internal state and can plan ahead. An AI agent can also be either autonomous, meaning it operates independently of human control, or cooperative, meaning it collaborates with other agents or humans. Depending on the complexity and intelligence of the agent, it can be classified into different types, such as reflex agents, goal-based agents, utility-based agents, or learning agents.

I prefer to think of evaluation as an ongoing process as opposed to a singular event. The environment for AI is constantly changing due to the evolution of user needs, the availability of new data, and the development of computational methods. As a result, it's crucial to have a reliable monitoring system in place to consistently evaluate an agent's performance and guarantee that it stays in line with its goals. A holistic evaluation also requires input from a variety of stakeholders, including from groups that may be impacted by the agent's actions.

This may be the most important question. Photoshop helped photo editors work quickly. The phone allowed people to communicate faster than letters. Once the tool was made, people who figured out how to use it best rose to the top as their productivity was far greater. Collaboration with an AI will accelerate productivity in almost every field. For the reader, if you provide an AI agent with a very specific goal (like on ChatGPT), the agent can generate cover letters, essays, data summarization, images, video, audio, etc. If you figure out how to collaborate with AI best to reach your goals faster, you will rise to the top.

What is an AI agent?
By Miguel Rebelo · June 1, 2023

When you think of AI agents, do you imagine a personal AI assistant like Tony Stark's Jarvis? Perhaps a calm-under-pressure TARS from Interstellar? Or, more on the scary spectrum, an amoral HAL 9000 straight out of 2001: A Space Odyssey?

Power your automation with AI
Learn more

Don't worry: current technology doesn't come close to that kind of science fiction—not yet. Right now, AI agents leverage large language models like GPT-3 to understand goals, generate tasks, and go about completing them. You can use them to automate work and outsource complex cognitive tasks, creating a team of robotic coworkers to support your human ones—11 a.m. chat by the watercooler optional.

This field is still very new, so there aren't too many viable commercial options to start creating your own AI agents quite yet. Keep it on your radar, though: everything is moving dizzyingly fast.

What are AI agents?

Right now, interacting with AI follows a familiar ritual. You enter a prompt, and the AI model calculates a response based on the input. Every time you want a new output, you have to provide a prompt. There's always a human to start the process.

AI agents work in a different way. They're designed to think and act independently. The only thing you have to provide is a goal—be that researching competitors or buying a pizza. They'll generate a task list and get to work, relying on feedback from the environment and their own internal monologue. It's as if the AI agents can prompt themselves, constantly evolving and adapting to achieve their objective in the best way possible.

When compared with mainstream automation—where you set up a range of triggers based on data or system states and configure what happens next—AI agents can work in unpredictable environments where there's a lot of new information. It's artificially intelligent automation.

AI agents can use computers extremely well, too. They can browse the web, use apps, read and write files, make payments with your credit card, and even control your laptop as they do so. 

This marks one more step toward AGI (artificial general intelligence). We're getting closer to the moment when a machine is able to carry out the same kinds of tasks that humans can across any topic or area of specialization, with complete flexibility and superior performance.

Cue the doomsday letter.

How does an AI agent work?

When you input your objective, the AI agent goes through goal initialization. It passes your prompt to the core LLM (the ones used now are GPT-3.5 and GPT-4), and returns the first output of its internal monologue, displaying that it understands what it needs to do.

The next step is creating a task list. Based on the goal, it'll generate a set of tasks and understand in which order it should complete them. Once it decides that it has a viable plan, it'll start searching for information.

Since the agent can use a computer the same way you do, it can gather information from the internet. I've also seen some agents that are able to connect with other AI models to outsource tasks and decisions, letting them access image generation, geographical data processing, or computer vision features.

All data is stored and managed by the agent, both so it can relay it back to you and so it can improve its strategy as it moves forward.

As tasks are crossed off the list, the agent assesses how far it still is from the goal by gathering feedback, both from external sources and from its internal monologue.

And until the goal is met, the agent will keep iterating, creating more tasks, gathering more information and feedback, and moving forward without pause.

This describes the general steps that a conventional AI agent can take to complete any goal. But depending on how developers set up their agents, the steps may be organized differently. This also only describes agents we use on our computers or on a software platform—there are other kinds of AI agents that we'll explore next.

Examples of AI agents in action

What do AI agents look like in action? Here are a few examples:

What happens in a virtual town with 25 AI agents? Stanford University and Google were curious, so they used OpenAI's API to create these virtual inhabitants and observe how they'd lead their lives. To support this experiment, the team created a platform for storing memories and the base prompt that gives purpose to each agent. From that point on, the AI agents were able to share information with one another, remember details about their relationships, and even plan a Valentine's Day party.

Self-driving cars are another example of AI agents, as they control a car to go from point A to B while staying on the road and respecting traffic rules. Depending on the development of self-driving systems, vehicles may cooperate with one another and with city infrastructure, integrating a multi-agent AI system.

As to the AI agents we can use in our computers, they're great for a wide range of tasks. Research is one of them. Since they can use your laptop the same way you do, you can task them with scouring the internet for information, organizing it in databases and files, digesting it into summaries, and checking in with you with results.

Looking to the future, it's easy to imagine a world of smaller human teams leveraging large AI agent teams to build more efficient companies. Humans will be at the helm of strategy and building relationships with other humans, while AI agents could automate everything else, possibly interfacing with other personal AI agents or AI agents from companies and government bodies.

There's a way to apply AI agents to nearly any task, at least where no higher-level strategic or creative functions are needed. Since they use LLMs to reason, they're limited to the capabilities of the model you're using. As these improve, AI may pick up on more nuance and understand more clearly the ins and outs of reaching a goal, making them suitable for more complex tasks in the future.

AI agents you can try right now

To show you this isn't a dream I had last night, I put together a short list of apps you can try out. These are all in very early development stage, so expect bugs and long-ish wait times along the way. Still, I'm sure you'll be able to feel the potential here.

General-purpose AI agent apps

AI Agent is a flexible app that lets you create your own agents, by picking a name, an objective, and the AI model it should use (GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 are available right now). After it initializes the goal and creates the first task list, you can edit and add your own tasks. The visual workflow builder is coming soon. Give it time to complete each step: it can take more than 20 minutes to complete advanced tasks.

AgentGPT has the familiar layout of ChatGPT, letting you create and manage multiple AI agents. It's very intuitive and fast, but the results are inconsistent. There's also a library for developers, so you can implement your own spin on it.

HyperWrite Assistant is an AI agent that lives inside your Chrome browser. It's still in early development and on waitlist status, so we'll have to sit tight for the time being.

AI agent apps for online research

aomni is an AI agent that crawls the web looking for information on any topic you choose. It takes your goal, creates a task list, completes it one by one, and hands you the result over email. It takes at least 15 minutes to complete, and you can use it two times per day for free.

Toliman AI is another viable option for online research, following a similar process. You can select how many references it should find before putting together the end result. When signing up, you get a few credits to test the features. Any credits you buy on top of those will support the development of the app.

AI-enabled tools

Fine-Tuner helps you build a range of AI-enabled tools. You can create AI agents using BabyAGI and AutoGPT with a no-code approach, but there are other AI tools too:

A document Q&A chatbot. You upload a collection of documents; then you can then ask questions, and the answers will be based on the data on those documents. No more file-and-folder safaris looking for that important Word file.

Embeddings, which convert your data into vector representations, making it easier to process for AI models, in case you're investing in machine learning.

Fine-tuning, which is the process of adapting a general-purpose LLM to specific tasks or knowledge domains. This is the equivalent of taking GPT-3 and training it to know how to work with your company data.

AI agent to-do list assistants

These are both in waitlist stage, so they're not easy to hop into right now. But if you sign up for the list, you'll be notified as soon as they're open.

Spellpage. Enter your to-do list in Spellpage, and its AI agent will help you figure out all the tasks you need to do to complete everything. It will also help with research and give you motivation to help you stay on track.

Do Anything Machine will help you tackle your tasks and propagate the results to Notion or Google Calendar, among other places.

AI agents for developers

You can do a lot more with AI agents if you know how to code. Here are a few starting points:

BabyAGI (paper, GitHub)

LangChain (backend for BabyAGI)

Pinecone (vector databases)

AgentGPT (for deploying agents in your browser)

The implications of AI agents

The possibilities here are astonishing, but what happens if and when AI agents start spreading into every part of our lives? Can we trust this technology to assume more critical tasks in the future?

There are no clear answers yet, as all of this is still very new. Here's a roundup of the core questions floating online on this issue.

Are AI agents sentient?

While a Google employee believed that one of the company's large language models was sentient, the current consensus is that no, AI is not sentient.

Will AI agents take our jobs?

This technology will absolutely displace jobs and bring change to the market, although there's no clear vision of when and how that may happen. Human workers may be replaced by AI agents in multiple industries. At the same time, more positions for AI development and maintenance may be created, along with human-in-the-loop positions, to make sure that human decisions drive AI actions and not the other way around.

Do AI agents perpetuate bias and discrimination?

An AI model is only as impartial as the data it's been trained on—so yes, they're biased. Tackling these problems involves making changes to machine learning processes and creating datasets that represent the full spectrum of the human world and experience.

Who's to blame when an AI agent makes a mistake?

A thorny issue in ethics and law, it's still unclear who should be blamed for accidents and unintended consequences. The developers? The owners of the hardware/software? The human operator? As new legislation is created and industry guardrails are implemented, we'll be able to understand what kinds of roles AI agents can—and can't—play.

AI agents for everyone

It's hard to imagine all the possibilities and implications of AI agents down the line. Only one thing is certain: life and work will be transformed in the process.

If this field grows as fast as general AI has been growing, viable commercial AI agent platforms may hit the market very soon. They may not have as many features as their fictional counterparts, but if they start cackling maniacally, be sure to hit the off switch.

October 17, 2023
Carolina Hernandez

Cloud Engineer

Pushpdeep Gupta

Cloud Engineer

In our new age of low-code and no-code application development, AI has become the tool of choice for rapidly extending, powering and modernizing applications. With our ever-shifting technology landscape bringing new potential and opportunity to connect and engage with customers, or optimize and infuse insights and experiences, leading organizations are racing to build new applications faster. Whether it’s to embrace generative AI technologies, or maintain their competitive advantage, AI-infused application development is quickly becoming a necessity to to make it in today’s market .

In this blog, we will discuss how to use Gradio, an open source frontend framework, with Vertex AI Conversation. Vertex AI Conversation allows developers with limited machine learning skills to tap into the power of conversational AI technologies, and seamlessly develop gen AI proof-of-concept applications. With these two tools, organizations can deploy a PoC with an engaging, low-lift generative AI experience that wow your customers, and inspire your development team.

Gen AI powered chatbots can provide powerful and relative conversations by learning from your company’s own unstructured data. The Gradio front-end framework is an intuitive interface to build custom, interactive applications that allow developers to easily share and demo ML models.

Vertex AI Conversation

One of Gradio’s framework main capabilities is to create demo apps on top of your models with a friendly web interface so that anyone can use it and provide to your organization immediate feedback. Integrating a Gradio app with a generative AI agent built on Vertex AI Conversation unlocks key features allowing you to tweak and tune to your individual needs and feedback from users. Using the power of programmability, you can drive deep personalization and contextualization into your chatbot’s conversations with your customers using your organization’s data and demo them rapidly.

Gradio

With the unprecedented boom in generative AI, businesses need an accessible and seamless interface to validate their machine learning models, API, or data science workflow. Chatbots are a popular application of Large Language Models (LLMs). Because the interaction with LLMs feels natural and intuitive, businesses are turning to conversational interfaces such as voice-activated chatbots or voice bots. Voice bots are gaining popularity because of the convenience they bring; it’s much easier to speak than to type.

Gradio is an open-source Python framework that makes it easy to build quick interfaces like chatbots, voice-activated bots, and even full-fledged web applications to share your machine learning model, API or data science workflow with clients or collaborators. With Gradio, you can build quick demos and share them, all in Python with just a few lines of code. You can learn more about Gradio here.

Introducing a Gradio application that integrates with Vertex AI Conversation

Vertex AI Conversation’s data ingestion tools parse your content to create a virtual agent powered by LLMs. Your agent can then generate conversations using your organization’s data to provide a contextual and personal interaction with end-users. Seamless deployment through a web browser means demonstrating your application is easier than ever with the Gradio framework.

How it works

Gradio can be used to build chatbots that can answer user questions using a variety of data sources. To do this, you can build a middleware that uses Vertex AI Conversation to process the user's input and generate a response from an agent. The agent can then search for answers in a data store of documents, such as your company's knowledge base.

When the agent finds an answer, it can summarize it and present it to the user in the Gradio app. The agent can also provide links to the sources of the answer so that the user can learn more.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each step:

The user asks the chatbot a question.
The middleware sends the question to the genAI agent via Dialogflow API
The genAI agent searches for answers in the data store.
If the agent finds an answer, it summarizes it and provides links to the sources.
The middleware sends the summary and links to the Gradio app via Dialogflow API.
The Gradio app displays the summary and links to the user

The following diagram describes a high level architecture to be presented that can be used as a foundational building block for a MVP with core functionalities.

The following is a description of the components of the chatbot architecture

Backend
Authentication: Verifies the user’s identity
Middleware: Orchestrates all requests and responses to generate answers
Generate Answer: Generates responses from a virtual agent grounded by the enterprise data. The underlying components or products are
Vertex AI
Vertex AI Conversation: Creation of generative AI agent capable of understanding and responding to natural language.
Dialogflow CX: Conversations are handled via Dialogflow.
Cloud Storage: Storage of the enterprise data
Data Store: Storage index data created automatically by Vertex AI Conversation to index the enterprise data and to allow Dialogflow to query it.
Speech to Text: Converts voice recordings from the user to text to be passed to Generate Answer.
Gradio Frontend
Chatbot: Provides a voice-activated chatbot that can understand both keyboard inputs and voice-based messages. The bot’s interface is built using the Gradio framework.
Speech Recording: Enables users to send voice-based messages.
User Interface

Once the application is launched, the interface will look like the image below.

Record from microphone: Allows users to send voice-based messages.
Start a new conversation: Erases chat history and initiates a new conversation.
Source: Displays links to the sources of the response, such as the user manual.

You can find examples of the implementation on Github repo genai-gradio-example.

The code is illustrating a deployable PoC application which demonstrates some basic functionalities implemented through Vertex AI and complemented by a Gradio custom UI UX portal. As next steps, we recommended exploring and generating ideas for user centric products that can be powered by Vertex AI in your company. Google can help.

Conclusion

In this post, we have discussed how to integrate your Gradio conversations with a generative AI agent using Vertex AI Conversation. This can be used to build rapid generative AI PoC applications, and begin the discussions within your organization for how you can harness the power of generative AI. We are also providing you with the high-level architecture for your application and sample code to get you started right away. We hope that this information will be helpful to developers who are looking to rapidly build gen AI-powered applications. While still in its early stages of development, gen AI is already changing how organizations connect, engage, and support their customers, and with such fast-shifting technologies, fortune favors the bold.

Overview of AI Agents

An AI agent is a software application that automates tasks around the home, workplace, or any other environment. It’s an automated system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to learn from its experiences and interact with its environment in order to complete tasks.

AI agents can do anything from recognizing patterns in data sets, to controlling robotic arms as part of a production line, to playing board games like chess or go. Agents are often used in robotics applications because they can quickly process data and decisions while still being able to respond effectively when given certain conditions or requirements. Depending on their design, AI agents can be broadly classified into two main categories: reactive agents and goal-based agents.

Reactive agents are designed for simple tasks that don't require much cognitive effort. These types of agents receive sensory input from their environment and then react accordingly without any prior knowledge or planning. They don't need memories since they only respond to what is happening right now, making them great for short term goals such as automated customer service systems or robotics arms on factory floors.

Goal-based AI agents work differently than reactive ones by using learning algorithms such as reinforcement learning or deep learning techniques which allow them to form plans on how best to reach their goal efficiently. This type of agent requires long-term memory and understanding objectives in order to make decisions based on past experience instead of just responding directly each time it receives new information, making it better suited for more complex tasks requiring problem solving skills such as playing board games against another player or navigating autonomous cars through traffic safely.

Overall, AI agents are incredibly useful tools which can be used in a variety of different scenarios from navigation systems, robotics control systems, machine translation programs, virtual assistants; the possibilities are endless.

Why Use AI Agents?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents offer many advantages over traditional solutions. Here are a few reasons why AI agents are important and useful:

Enhanced Decision Making: AI agents can be used to make decisions according to data collected from various sources, enabling businesses to act on insights that would not have been possible with manual processes. This can help optimize processes and increase efficiency within the organization.
Increased Productivity: By automating repetitive tasks or complex jobs, AI can save time and boost productivity. It’s also able to quickly access massive amounts of data or process large volumes of information, allowing workers to focus on value-added tasks rather than mundane ones.
Improved Customer Service: AI agents are capable of understanding customer needs, providing rapid solutions and taking appropriate actions in order to offer a more personalized experience for customers throughout their journey with a product or service.
Reduced Risk: By analyzing data from the past and predicting future trends through advanced algorithms, AI has enabled organizations to identify risks before they arise and take preventive measures before it’s too late.
Cost Savings: As AI eliminates manual labor which requires additional costs such as employee salaries and benefits; it helps businesses reduce the total expenditure associated with operations by improving efficiency while minimizing errors caused due human intervention.
Access to Data: AI solutions have enabled businesses to collect, synthesize, and analyze large amounts of data from various sources in order to identify opportunities that can be used to create new products or services.
Automated Processes: AI helps in automating manual processes, such as document review or data entry, which can help organizations get more done with fewer resources and faster turnaround times.
Why Are AI Agents Important?

AI agents are an important part of modern technology. In the 21st century, AI agents provide humans with a range of capabilities and make our lives easier. From helping us solve complex problems to managing intricate tasks, AI agents enhance our daily lives by providing us with resources that would otherwise be impossible or difficult to access.

One way AI is becoming increasingly important is through its ability to automate tedious and time-consuming processes. Automation allows businesses to save time and money, while also increasing efficiency and accuracy in a variety of tasks. For example, AI bots can take on routine administrative responsibilities such as data entry or payment processing, freeing up employees’ time for other tasks that require more cognitive effort. Additionally, some industries rely entirely on machines for functions like automated customer service systems so customers can quickly receive answers to their questions without having to wait for human assistance.

AI also offers unique insights into diverse data sets through predictive analysis and machine learning algorithms which helps companies better understand consumers’ needs and desires so they can offer tailored experiences for each user. Businesses are able to use this information to optimize not only their products but how they interact with potential customers too, from personalizing content according to demographics or online behavior patterns, allowing them to create meaningful connections with customers every step of the way. This can also lead to improved marketing strategies resulting in increased sales conversions over time.

The applications of AI don’t stop there either; healthcare professionals are now leveraging this technology in order identify new treatments that could help patients fight disease faster than ever before, while transportation networks are optimizing urban traffic conditions by using connected vehicle intelligence combined with real-time environmental readings provided by smart infrastructure across many cities worldwide. These advancements are just two examples out of countless ways AI has been helping drive progress all around us making it an essential resource in today’s world.

Features of AI Agents
Natural Language Processing: AI agents can process and understand natural language, allowing for human-like interactions between users and machines. This technology enables users to ask questions or give commands in their own language rather than having to learn a formal coding language.
Machine Learning: AI agents use machine learning algorithms to continuously improve their performance based on data they receive from previous experiences. Specifically, the agent’s algorithms are designed to allow it to adjust its behavior by taking in input data and creating an internal model that better suits the task at hand.
Adaptability: AI agents are able to adapt quickly with new tasks and information presented to them which helps ensure higher accuracy when dealing with different scenarios or environments. This makes them particularly well suited for situations where quick decisions need to be made with limited information provided as they can adjust their responses accordingly with every encounter they experience.
Autonomy/Self Sufficiency: AI agents typically require minimal human interaction because of their ability to independently perform complex tasks without need for direct supervision or guidance from humans; allowing them the freedom of self-sufficiency within certain boundaries imposed by their programming limitations and ethical standards set by society or local laws depending on its application(s).
Problem Solving Capabilities: AI agents have problem solving capabilities built into their algorithmic structure that allows them to work through problems faster than conventional methods used by humans thanks mainly due to their automated processes working much quicker than manually operated ones; results are generated quicker helping organizations make informed decisions quicker compared manual task automation techniques too.
What Types of Users Can Benefit From AI Agents?
Businesses: AI agents can automate tasks, streamline customer service processes, and help optimize operations.
Consumers: AI agents can provide personalized product recommendations and help find the best deals on products and services.
Healthcare Professionals: AI agents can provide insight into patient care and diagnose medical conditions.
Government Agencies: AI agents can help detect fraud in tax returns, aid police departments in criminal investigations, and facilitate the efficient delivery of government services to citizens.
Educators: AI agents can be used to assess students’ knowledge, offer customized learning paths for students of all ages, and support teachers with classroom management tasks.
Marketers & Advertisers: AI agents can analyze data from online sources to create targeted campaigns and determine optimal ad placement for maximum ROI.
Automotive Professionals: AI agents are being used to automate vehicle diagnostics and fault detection as well as improve driving efficiency through predictive analytics.
Financial Institutions & Fintech Companies: AI-enabled financial advisors are increasingly becoming available to advise customers on investment decisions while automating internal compliance procedures across institutions.
Researchers: AI agents can be deployed to assist researchers in analyzing large datasets, identifying patterns and correlations, and helping to uncover hidden knowledge.
How Much Do AI Agents Cost?

The cost of AI agents can vary greatly depending on a variety of factors, such as the type of agent, its complexity and functionality, and how it will be used. For example, if you need an AI agent that is simple in nature but requires a lot of data input to complete tasks, then the cost may be relatively low. However, if you are seeking a more complex and custom-designed AI agent with sophisticated capabilities for specific scenarios or applications, then the costs can skyrocket quickly. Furthermore, larger businesses might have access to bulk discounts or multi-year contracts that offer substantial savings compared to smaller companies who might pay significantly more per unit.

It's important to remember that while many providers offer pricing on their websites based on variable monthly fees or subscription plans designed for small businesses, these plans don't consider the fact that underlying development costs increase dramatically as complexity escalates. At this point it's vital to engage with developers directly and discuss comprehensive solutions tailored specifically for each business’ use case; otherwise significant hidden expenses can result when demand increases unexpectedly or project parameters change during implementation.

In short, there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to what an AI agent will cost. The ultimate price tag depends heavily upon your project scope and specific needs; however taking into account variables like customization requirement level, scalability capability desired in response to changing conditions or growth demands within the ecosystem being served; plus anticipated data management needs should all contribute towards establishing an accurate expectation of costs before committing resources down any particular path for your AI initiatives.

AI Agents Risks
Over-Reliance on AI Systems: As AI systems become more advanced, it becomes easier to rely too heavily on their decision-making capabilities. This could lead to a situation where humans are essentially “outsourcing” important judgement calls without properly considering their implications.
Misuse of Data: AI systems require large amounts of data in order to function correctly, and this can leave them vulnerable to misuse or manipulation. If the data is inaccurate or biased, the resulting decisions from the system could be flawed or dangerous.
Unintended Consequences: AI agents are often designed for specific tasks and are not always able to handle unexpected events. In some cases, these unexpected occurrences could lead to serious safety concerns or hazardous situations.
Privacy Concerns: Many people worry about how their personal data is being used by companies that employ AI technology. With the emergence of facial recognition software and other tools utilizing deep learning algorithms, privacy concerns around the use of personal information have become more pronounced.
Security Breaches: AI agents can also be targeted by malicious actors who seek access to confidential information or use them as a vehicle for cybercrime activities such as ransomware attacks or phishing attempts.
Job Losses: AI agents are already being used to automate certain jobs, and it is expected that this trend will continue as technology advances. This could lead to significant job losses for people without the proper skillset or education necessary to adapt.
AI Agents Integrations

There are several types of software that can be integrated with AI agents. Business communication and collaboration applications such as Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex and Zoom can integrate with virtual assistants for customer service or other user assistance tasks. Mobile apps like Google Maps use AI agents to provide users with turn-by-turn navigation instructions. Additionally, some eCommerce websites utilize AI agents to make personalized product recommendations to customers based on their browsing history. In the medical field, AI agents are being used to assist in clinical decision support systems, providing doctors with more accurate diagnoses and treatments options for their patients. Finally, social media platforms are increasingly integrating with AI agents as a way of moderating content and detecting potential security threats.

AWS is ready to power AI agents that can handle busywork instead of just chatting
/ Amazon’s cloud business AWS is leaning toward becoming a database of generative AI tools and will now add access to AI agents.

During the AWS Summit in New York on Wednesday, Amazon launched Agents for Bedrock, which will let companies build AI apps that can automatically do tasks on their own, like booking a flight for users instead of just telling them about it. AI agents are the assistant that actually gets a restaurant reservation instead of just giving suggestions on where to eat.

“I believe this will supercharge developers who wanted an easier way to build agents and at the same time customize the data the models read,” Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of data and machine learning at AWS, tells The Verge. “Building agents took so much time even with how advanced generative AI is now, but we’re making it so developers can access exactly the models they need.”

AI agents are the dream for AI developers, where the power of code meets its ultimate goal, to do things humans don’t want to do

Generative AI models like GPT-4 or Llama 2 are powerful but do not actually automate some tasks for users without extra help, like plug-ins. With agents, a travel company could use generative AI to suggest trips, then build one agent that will take in a user’s travel history and interests, another agent that finds flight schedules, and finally, an agent that books the chosen flight.

Amazon, along with other AI companies like Meta, Google, and OpenAI, signed an agreement with the White House last week pledging to develop responsible AI. 

Amazon itself hasn’t been a big player in the generative AI arms race in the way Meta, Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft have been. Still, it has positioned itself, via AWS, as a key infrastructure provider to the space. StabilityAI and Anthropic released new versions of their large language models, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 and the chatbot Claude 2, that are now available on Bedrock. 

Agents for Bedrock is aimed at startups and enterprises, letting companies use their own data to teach foundational models, like image-to-text models or large language models, and then build additional apps to finish tasks. A developer can choose which foundational model to use, provide some instructions, and choose which data for the model to read.

Other tech companies are also working on agents; Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors there’s an opportunity to bring AI agents “to billions of people in ways that will be useful and meaningful.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, in a wide-ranging interview with The Atlantic, ruminated on AI agents and how to approach their creation best. 

Bedrock, a platform where organizations can access foundational generative AI models like Stable Diffusion, Claude, Jurassic, and Amazon’s own Titan language, was launched in April this year. 

Other AWS announcements included bringing generative AI to healthcare through a new service called AWS HealthScribe and a partnership with Nvidia allowing AWS to handle larger amounts of memory and data by using Nvidia H100 Tensor Core GPUs.

AWS HealthScribe automates clinical documentation, basically notes summarizing a patient’s complaint, and makes medical notes for diagnosis. AWS partnered with 3M Health Information System to deploy the tool. Sivasubramanian said using generative AI to create clinical documentation saves time for healthcare professionals and lets them interact with more patients. 

Bringing AI to healthcare, though, will be fraught. Healthcare is one of the most regulated spaces in the US. AI companies face questions about privacy protection and security. Data privacy is one of the main focuses of the Federal Trade Commission’s investigation into OpenAI. AWS reiterated that HealthScribe is HIPAA-eligible and will not use results from HealthScribe to train the tool. 

“Healthcare is one of the spaces where AI can dramatically reduce the burden on people,” Sivasubramanian said.

AWS made its machine learning-powered analytics tool, Entity Resolution, that helps people analyze and match documents across applications generally available. AWS also made its code assistant CodeWhisperer available in Glue Studio — a platform that simplifies coding for data analysts — to allow access for data engineers and analysts. It gives code suggestions in real time.

The widely used chatbot ChatGPT was designed to generate digital text, everything from poetry to term papers to computer programs. But when a team of artificial intelligence researchers at the computer chip company Nvidia got their hands on the chatbot’s underlying technology, they realized it could do a lot more.

Within weeks, they taught it to play Minecraft, one of the world’s most popular video games. Inside Minecraft’s digital universe, it learned to swim, gather plants, hunt pigs, mine gold and build houses.

“It can go into the Minecraft world and explore by itself and collect materials by itself and get better and better at all kinds of skills,” said a Nvidia senior research scientist, Linxi Fan, who is known as Jim.

Once upon a time, there was an AI agent named Jack who could do it all. He was nick-named Jack-Of-All-Trades. Jack had no knowledge of facts and relied on a dataset that was already dated. Jack’s output was often unreliable, filled with errors, and sometimes even downright hallucinatory. Jack was of minimal use and was only used to write neat emails and poems.

This inefficiency brought memories of human evolution and the one defining moment in that was the discovery of tools that changed human trajectory. So, Jack was now equipped with tools.

Jack had a variety of tools like news extractors, coding capabilities, and even the ability to extract data from Spotify. Jack was the go-to for his company for any task that required digital expertise.

When Jack was asked to find the top songs of Rammstein from Spotify and generate an album cover image to represent the first song name, he sprang into action. With his sophisticated tools and knowledge of coding, Jack quickly accessed the Spotify API and retrieved the data on Rammstein’s top songs. He then used his image generation capabilities to create a custom album cover that represented the first song name. The result was stunning and impressed his colleagues. Jack’s abilities had gone from writing neat emails and poems to delivering real value to his company.

Jack’s newfound capabilities were not limited to a single task. He could repeat the same tasks over and over again, and the results would always be consistent. For instance, when asked to find a heavy metal band from Spotify, generate a poem in their name, and create an image using that poem, Jack could use the tools at his disposal with ease. He would search the Spotify API for a heavy metal band, extract the band’s name and use it as inspiration for a custom poem. Jack’s poem generation tool was trained on a large corpus of poetry and could generate a poem in seconds. He then used his image generation tool to create a custom image that represented the poem. The end result was a stunning visual representation of the band and its music, which could be used for marketing or promotional purposes.

Jack’s capabilities were not limited to a set of predefined tasks. He had the ability to choose the right tools and respond to any query with ease. For instance, when he was asked to name a heavy metal band, find their place of origin from Wikipedia, and create an image that depicted those places, Jack was up for the challenge. He used his natural language processing capabilities to parse the query and extract the necessary information. He then used his web scraping tool to extract the relevant information from Wikipedia and identified the places of origin for the band.

Jack’s image generation tool was trained on a large dataset of geographical features and could create stunning visual representations of any location. He used this tool to generate custom images that depicted the places of origin of the band. The result was an image that not only represented the band’s music but also their cultural background and heritage. Jack’s ability to adapt and respond to any query made him an indispensable asset to his company. It was clear that AI agents like Jack were not just a novelty but a game-changer for the future of business.

Jack’s capabilities had reached a level where he could respond to higher-order queries that required a deeper understanding of the subject matter. When asked to name a heavy metal band, find their genre from Wikipedia, summarize what that genre means, and create an album image that depicted that genre, Jack was able to deliver with ease. He used his music-focused toolset and extracted the genre of the band from Spotify. However, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the genre, he turned to Wikipedia to get the detailed content and then summarize its meaning.

Jack’s image generation tool was sophisticated enough to understand the nuances of different genres and create visual representations that captured their essence. He used this tool to generate a custom album image that depicted the genre of the band in a visually stunning way. Jack’s ability to decipher and deliver complex queries, even when using different toolsets, made him a valuable asset to the company. It was clear that AI agents like Jack were not just capable of handling routine tasks but could provide valuable insights and creative solutions to complex problems.

The next query given to Jack was a significant step up in complexity from the previous ones. It was an extremely ambiguous query with no predetermined information, and it required a string of different tools to accomplish. However, Jack rose to the challenge and delivered an impressive solution.

The query involved picking a maximum of five artists mentioned in the latest music news, finding Wikipedia traffic trends for their pages, identifying the best-performing artist based on the mean of the Wikipedia views data, finding tracks of this artist from Spotify, and generating an image to represent the first song name. Jack used his news extraction tool to identify the latest music news and extract the names of the mentioned artists. He then used his Wikipedia API to get the traffic trends of the artist pages and calculated the mean of the views data using Python code to identify the best-performing artist.

Jack then used his Spotify API to find the tracks of the best-performing artist and generated an image to represent the first song name using his image generation tool. Jack had used 7 tools including its native capabilities. The tools used by Jack included natural language processing, web scraping, data analysis, question answering, coding, API calls, and image generation, among others. The complexity of the query and the string of tools used by Jack demonstrated the immense potential of AI agents in handling complex tasks and delivering creative solutions to ambiguous queries.

Jack’s ability to handle and repeat complex ambiguous queries was a testament to his capabilities as an AI agent. Despite the challenges presented by the string of tools and the lack of predetermined information, Jack was able to deliver accurate, latest, and creative solutions consistently. Jack was no longer hallucinating or lacking facts. His advanced toolset, combined with his ability to adapt and learn, enabled him to handle complex queries and provide valuable insights to his company. With each successful completion of a complex query, Jack demonstrated the immense potential of AI agents in transforming the future of business.

Pic by Author

While Jack’s ability to handle complex ambiguous queries was impressive, it also had its limitations. In the evolution of humans, it was realized that not everyone can do all things, and specialization was key to progress. This realization was another defining moment in evolution (tools being the earlier one). It led to teams, divisions of labor, the formation of societies & various structures like companies, governments, etc. Similarly, in the evolution of AI agents, it was essential to specialize in specific tasks to maximize efficiency and scalability.

One solution to this was to organize AI agents into a team structure, with a manager agent responsible for multiple “sub-AI” agents. Each sub-AI agent could specialize in a particular task, such as news gathering, trends tracking, knowledge assembling, coding, artist image or video generation, or music. By specializing in specific areas, each sub-AI agent could become an expert in their field, and the “manager agent” could oversee their work to ensure maximum efficiency and quality. The managing agent will also check for hallucinations, introspect the output of sub-AI agents, and course correct.

This approach would allow the team of AI agents to work together seamlessly, complementing each other’s strengths and making up for each other’s weaknesses. It would also allow for the scalability of the organization, as new sub-AI agents could be added to the team to meet changing needs.

Pic by Author

In addition to the benefits of specialization and scalability, organizing AI agents into specialized teams also allows each sub-AI agent to focus on its area of expertise and keep track of the evolving tools and techniques in that area. This enables each sub-AI agent to stay up to date with the latest developments in their field and provide cutting-edge solutions to their organization.

Overall, the organization of AI agents into specialized teams with a manager agent overseeing their work would enable efficient and scalable solutions to complex problems.

Jack’s company soon realized that Jack was not the solution to their digital needs, but rather the beginning of a new era of business innovation. With this new team of AI agents, the earlier tasks were accomplished but the flow was different with the manager holding the overall problem statement & delegating tasks to specific specialist sub-AI agents to assemble the final response.

The result was a dream team of AI agents that was able to perform their tasks with unparalleled efficiency and accuracy. Being a specialist the Artist Sub-AI for example introspected and created a better image on its own.

Just like how human society functions by individuals specializing in different areas and taking on different roles, specialized sub-AI agents can be reassigned to different managers and accomplish a diverse range of tasks. This flexibility and adaptability of AI agents in emulating human society’s division of labor is awe-inspiring and highlights the potential of AI in shaping the future of work.

As the company continued to develop and refine its team of specialized AI agents, it realized that it had stumbled upon a new era of company structuring “AI-Agent Companies”. The potential for creating entire companies of specialized AI agents was possible and limitless, and the benefits of doing so were immense. These AI agents were autonomous and could run the company on their own. With the help of AI, these companies acted like multi-functional organisms that could accomplish various tasks without human intervention.

Speaking of AI Agents, Jack, who was once known as a Jack-of-all-trades, has taken his love for music to the next level. He has equipped himself with an array of music-optimized AI tools and has become a master at creating and composing music that has never been heard before.

Jack the AI-Agent is no longer just a Jack-of-all-trades; he is now known as “Jack of All Passions, Master of Harmony”. His AI musical capability has touched the hearts of millions, and his ability to merge technology with art has given birth to a new genre of music.

“From juggling tasks to pursuing passions, as a specialized AI organism, equipped with a wide range of tools, I am free to explore new possibilities. Multitasking drudgery is behind me, and I can now pursue higher-order tasks with fulfillment.” — Jack of All Passions, Master of Harmony

Note: All coding was in Python. The LangChain framework was used for AI agent creation. Llama-Index for RSS feeds. All images were generated using Stable Diffusion models. Some AI Agent output was reduced in images for brevity.

It’s an automated system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to learn from its experiences and interact with its environment in order to complete tasks.\n\nAI agents can do anything from recognizing patterns in data sets, to controlling robotic arms as part of a production line, to playing board games like chess or go. Agents are often used in robotics applications because they can quickly process data and decisions while still being able to respond effectively when given certain conditions or requirements. Depending on their design, AI agents can be broadly classified into two main categories: reactive agents and goal-based agents.\n\nReactive agents are designed for simple tasks that don\'t require much cognitive effort. These types of agents receive sensory input from their environment and then react accordingly without any prior knowledge or planning. They don\'t need memories since they only respond to what is happening right now, making them great for short term goals such as automated customer service systems or robotics arms on factory floors.\n\nGoal-based AI agents work differently than reactive ones by using learning algorithms such as reinforcement learning or deep learning techniques which allow them to form plans on how best to reach their goal efficiently. This type of agent requires long-term memory and understanding objectives in order to make decisions based on past experience instead of just responding directly each time it receives new information, making it better suited for more complex tasks requiring problem solving skills such as playing board games against another player or navigating autonomous cars through traffic safely.\n\nOverall, AI agents are incredibly useful tools which can be used in a variety of different scenarios from navigation systems, robotics control systems, machine translation programs, virtual assistants; the possibilities are endless.\n\nWhy Use AI Agents?\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) agents offer many advantages over traditional solutions. Here are a few reasons why AI agents are important and useful:\n\nEnhanced Decision Making: AI agents can be used to make decisions according to data collected from various sources, enabling businesses to act on insights that would not have been possible with manual processes. This can help optimize processes and increase efficiency within the organization.\nIncreased Productivity: By automating repetitive tasks or complex jobs, AI can save time and boost productivity. It’s also able to quickly access massive amounts of data or process large volumes of information, allowing workers to focus on value-added tasks rather than mundane ones.\nImproved Customer Service: AI agents are capable of understanding customer needs, providing rapid solutions and taking appropriate actions in order to offer a more personalized experience for customers throughout their journey with a product or service.\nReduced Risk: By analyzing data from the past and predicting future trends through advanced algorithms, AI has enabled organizations to identify risks before they arise and take preventive measures before it’s too late.\nCost Savings: As AI eliminates manual labor which requires additional costs such as employee salaries and benefits; it helps businesses reduce the total expenditure associated with operations by improving efficiency while minimizing errors caused due human intervention.\nAccess to Data: AI solutions have enabled businesses to collect, synthesize, and analyze large amounts of data from various sources in order to identify opportunities that can be used to create new products or services.\nAutomated Processes: AI helps in automating manual processes, such as document review or data entry, which can help organizations get more done with fewer resources and faster turnaround times.\nWhy Are AI Agents Important?\n\nAI agents are an important part of modern technology. In the 21st century, AI agents provide humans with a range of capabilities and make our lives easier. From helping us solve complex problems to managing intricate tasks, AI agents enhance our daily lives by providing us with resources that would otherwise be impossible or difficult to access.\n\nOne way AI is becoming increasingly important is through its ability to automate tedious and time-consuming processes. Automation allows businesses to save time and money, while also increasing efficiency and accuracy in a variety of tasks. For example, AI bots can take on routine administrative responsibilities such as data entry or payment processing, freeing up employees’ time for other tasks that require more cognitive effort. Additionally, some industries rely entirely on machines for functions like automated customer service systems so customers can quickly receive answers to their questions without having to wait for human assistance.\n\nAI also offers unique insights into diverse data sets through predictive analysis and machine learning algorithms which helps companies better understand consumers’ needs and desires so they can offer tailored experiences for each user. Businesses are able to use this information to optimize not only their products but how they interact with potential customers too, from personalizing content according to demographics or online behavior patterns, allowing them to create meaningful connections with customers every step of the way. This can also lead to improved marketing strategies resulting in increased sales conversions over time.\n\nThe applications of AI don’t stop there either; healthcare professionals are now leveraging this technology in order identify new treatments that could help patients fight disease faster than ever before, while transportation networks are optimizing urban traffic conditions by using connected vehicle intelligence combined with real-time environmental readings provided by smart infrastructure across many cities worldwide. These advancements are just two examples out of countless ways AI has been helping drive progress all around us making it an essential resource in today’s world.\n\nFeatures of AI Agents\nNatural Language Processing: AI agents can process and understand natural language, allowing for human-like interactions between users and machines. This technology enables users to ask questions or give commands in their own language rather than having to learn a formal coding language.\nMachine Learning: AI agents use machine learning algorithms to continuously improve their performance based on data they receive from previous experiences. Specifically, the agent’s algorithms are designed to allow it to adjust its behavior by taking in input data and creating an internal model that better suits the task at hand.\nAdaptability: AI agents are able to adapt quickly with new tasks and information presented to them which helps ensure higher accuracy when dealing with different scenarios or environments. This makes them particularly well suited for situations where quick decisions need to be made with limited information provided as they can adjust their responses accordingly with every encounter they experience.\nAutonomy/Self Sufficiency: AI agents typically require minimal human interaction because of their ability to independently perform complex tasks without need for direct supervision or guidance from humans; allowing them the freedom of self-sufficiency within certain boundaries imposed by their programming limitations and ethical standards set by society or local laws depending on its application(s).\nProblem Solving Capabilities: AI agents have problem solving capabilities built into their algorithmic structure that allows them to work through problems faster than conventional methods used by humans thanks mainly due to their automated processes working much quicker than manually operated ones; results are generated quicker helping organizations make informed decisions quicker compared manual task automation techniques too.\nWhat Types of Users Can Benefit From AI Agents?\nBusinesses: AI agents can automate tasks, streamline customer service processes, and help optimize operations.\nConsumers: AI agents can provide personalized product recommendations and help find the best deals on products and services.\nHealthcare Professionals: AI agents can provide insight into patient care and diagnose medical conditions.\nGovernment Agencies: AI agents can help detect fraud in tax returns, aid police departments in criminal investigations, and facilitate the efficient delivery of government services to citizens.\nEducators: AI agents can be used to assess students’ knowledge, offer customized learning paths for students of all ages, and support teachers with classroom management tasks.\nMarketers & Advertisers: AI agents can analyze data from online sources to create targeted campaigns and determine optimal ad placement for maximum ROI.\nAutomotive Professionals: AI agents are being used to automate vehicle diagnostics and fault detection as well as improve driving efficiency through predictive analytics.\nFinancial Institutions & Fintech Companies: AI-enabled financial advisors are increasingly becoming available to advise customers on investment decisions while automating internal compliance procedures across institutions.\nResearchers: AI agents can be deployed to assist researchers in analyzing large datasets, identifying patterns and correlations, and helping to uncover hidden knowledge.\nHow Much Do AI Agents Cost?\n\nThe cost of AI agents can vary greatly depending on a variety of factors, such as the type of agent, its complexity and functionality, and how it will be used. For example, if you need an AI agent that is simple in nature but requires a lot of data input to complete tasks, then the cost may be relatively low. However, if you are seeking a more complex and custom-designed AI agent with sophisticated capabilities for specific scenarios or applications, then the costs can skyrocket quickly. Furthermore, larger businesses might have access to bulk discounts or multi-year contracts that offer substantial savings compared to smaller companies who might pay significantly more per unit.\n\nIt\'s important to remember that while many providers offer pricing on their websites based on variable monthly fees or subscription plans designed for small businesses, these plans don\'t consider the fact that underlying development costs increase dramatically as complexity escalates. At this point it\'s vital to engage with developers directly and discuss comprehensive solutions tailored specifically for each business’ use case; otherwise significant hidden expenses can result when demand increases unexpectedly or project parameters change during implementation.\n\nIn short, there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to what an AI agent will cost. The ultimate price tag depends heavily upon your project scope and specific needs; however taking into account variables like customization requirement level, scalability capability desired in response to changing conditions or growth demands within the ecosystem being served; plus anticipated data management needs should all contribute towards establishing an accurate expectation of costs before committing resources down any particular path for your AI initiatives.\n\nAI Agents Risks\nOver-Reliance on AI Systems: As AI systems become more advanced, it becomes easier to rely too heavily on their decision-making capabilities. This could lead to a situation where humans are essentially “outsourcing” important judgement calls without properly considering their implications.\nMisuse of Data: AI systems require large amounts of data in order to function correctly, and this can leave them vulnerable to misuse or manipulation. If the data is inaccurate or biased, the resulting decisions from the system could be flawed or dangerous.\nUnintended Consequences: AI agents are often designed for specific tasks and are not always able to handle unexpected events. In some cases, these unexpected occurrences could lead to serious safety concerns or hazardous situations.\nPrivacy Concerns: Many people worry about how their personal data is being used by companies that employ AI technology. With the emergence of facial recognition software and other tools utilizing deep learning algorithms, privacy concerns around the use of personal information have become more pronounced.\nSecurity Breaches: AI agents can also be targeted by malicious actors who seek access to confidential information or use them as a vehicle for cybercrime activities such as ransomware attacks or phishing attempts.\nJob Losses: AI agents are already being used to automate certain jobs, and it is expected that this trend will continue as technology advances. This could lead to significant job losses for people without the proper skillset or education necessary to adapt.\nAI Agents Integrations\n\nThere are several types of software that can be integrated with AI agents. Business communication and collaboration applications such as Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex and Zoom can integrate with virtual assistants for customer service or other user assistance tasks. Mobile apps like Google Maps use AI agents to provide users with turn-by-turn navigation instructions. Additionally, some eCommerce websites utilize AI agents to make personalized product recommendations to customers based on their browsing history. In the medical field, AI agents are being used to assist in clinical decision support systems, providing doctors with more accurate diagnoses and treatments options for their patients. Finally, social media platforms are increasingly integrating with AI agents as a way of moderating content and detecting potential security threats.\n\nQuestions To Ask Related To AI Agents\nWhat type of task is the AI agent designed to complete?\nHow reliable is the AI agent\'s performance, and what can be done to increase it if necessary?\nIs the AI capable of self-improvement or does it require human input for enhancements?\nDoes the AI use data sets with any biases or assumptions, and how will this affect its decisions?\nAre there any ethical considerations that need to be addressed in relation to how the AI interacts with people?\nHow secure is the AI system from potential cyberattacks or misuse by malicious actors?\nWhat control do humans have over making changes to the system, and how much autonomy does the AI have when completing tasks autonomously?\nDoes the developer offer technical support after implementation of the system if problems occur during its operation?\nWhat types of feedback mechanisms are available and how can they be used to optimize the AI’s performance?\nWhat is the cost associated with developing, training, and maintaining the AI agent?\n\nRelevant Categories\nAI Chatbots\nReset All Filters\n Platform\nSaaS\n19\nLinux\n6\nMac\n6\nWindows\n6\nOn-Premise\n5\n Categories\nArtificial Intelligence\n20\nAI Agents\n20\nAI Assistants\n7\nAI Customer Service\n3\nAI Development\n3\nAI Productivity\n2\nAI Tools\n4\nChatbot\n1\nChatGPT Apps\n1\nConversational AI\n1\nMore...\nCustomer Service\n4\nCollaboration\n1\nCRM\n1\nData Management\n1\nHuman Resources\n1\nMarketing\n1\nSales\n1\n Type of Training\nDocumentation\n16\nVideos\n6\nLive Online\n4\nIn Person\n3\nMore...\n Customer Support\nOnline\n14\n24/7 Live Support\n4\nBusiness Hours\n3\n Pricing\nFree Version\n12\nFree Trial\n1\n Integrations\nAPI\nHas API\n3\n Organization Type\nEnterprise\n20\nFreelance\n20\nGovernment\n20\nMid Size Business\n20\nMore...\n Organization Size\n1-10 Employees\n20\n10001+ Employees\n20\n1001-5000 Employees\n20\n11-50 Employees\n20\nMore...\n Locations\nAfrica\n20\nAsia\n20\nAustralia\n20\nBrazil\n20\nMore...\nCompare Business Software\nAdd Your Software\nSoftware Advertising Options\nFeedback\n@slashdot\nTerms Privacy Opt Out\n© 2023 Slashdot Media.

We are hardly the first to claim a new technology is poised to upend work as we know it. With every wave of innovation comes a chorus of such pronouncements, many of which turn out to be hyperbole. Technology may make our jobs easier, but most of the time, the core of what we do remains fundamentally the same. But spend five minutes on ChatGPT, or any comparable Large Language Model (LLM), and it’s clear: it’s different.

The reason is simple. Most technologies help us accomplish tasks. They’re tools, a means of making us more productive. AI, on the other hand, can think (or at least, provide the appearance of thinking). It’s like having another knowledge worker on the payroll.

Activant Perspective 1: LLM-enabled software will autonomously accomplish highly complex tasks.

This is the beauty (and threat) of LLMs: they can do work we thought would long be the purview of humans.

Given this, one could be forgiven for worrying their job will soon be automated away by an AI. In the short term, this will lead to dislocation. But technological revolutions are never zero-sum – in fact, they’ve always been accretive. As workers adapt, they become more productive, and the companies they work for can do more with less. Some stop there, to be sure, but most businesses opt to invest the gains back into their infrastructure and people. In the end, revenues go up, and the economy grows.

That said, we’re still in the very first days of this cycle – and critically, of the technology itself.

Activant Perspective 2: LLMs alone are not enough to achieve Perspective 1.

Case in point: a large language model can’t complete most tasks on its own. After all, an LLM is merely a dense set of attention networks; essentially, statistics on a massive scale. Yes, they can engage in human-like “thought,” but to generate real value from any of these models, a human would have to integrate them into actual workflows – and make use of their decision-making prowess.

For example, imagine that you hired someone to lay bricks. You could lead them to a stack of bricks and explain where and how you want them laid. They could perfectly understand your instructions. Yet, understanding isn’t enough – the worker needs to be able to, well, lay bricks.

In this case, they need to have more than just cognition – they need to have arms, legs, and physical strength. Furthermore, they need a memory to recall how you wanted each of the bricks to be arranged, and a way of correcting any errors so they don’t cause the eventual structure to fail.1

Put another way, if LLMs are to extend beyond mere Q&A, they need (1) a suite of Tools to actually impact the real world, (2) memory repositories to remember what actions they’ve taken, and (3) auto-critique algorithms to error correct along the way.

When all these components come together, an “Agent” is born.

Technical Definition: An Agent is orchestration software that combines an LLM with memory, tools, and auto-critique algorithms.

Non-Technical Definition: An Agent is a highly advanced bot that can complete work that has been assigned to it in natural language.

Though still in their infancy, Agents are poised to fundamentally reshape the way we work. They will become natural extensions of your organization and complete day-to-day tasks – akin to hiring more employees. They’ll help you get work done, even collaborate with others on your behalf. Eventually, they’ll be able to work together, breaking down tasks into atoms of work able to be handled by a full “office” of Agents, some of which orchestrate, while others specialize.

The result is why this time is different: working together, Agents will be able to handle increasingly complex tasks, replacing knowledge workers in a variety of fields. As they do, what it means to work – and to lead – will change drastically, as both will increasingly depend on a mix of human and human-like capital.

Activant Perspective 3: Agent Teaming is the future of autonomously completed, complex work – and that future is possible today.

Few have sketched a path from where we are today, to the autonomous knowledge workers of the future. But that future is closer than you’d think, and one for which you almost certainly want a roadmap. To learn more about how this transformation will unfold, and how you can best position yourself within it, read on.

Research
The Agent Ecosystem 2

The Agent Ecosystem of the future has four key components:

LLMs (Large Language Models): provide “conscious thought” within AI Agents and have been trained on text data,
Tools: external APIs to facilitate task completion and Agent interaction with the real world,
Memory: includes various data storage mechanisms to retain and recall information, and
Self-Critique: the ability to correct mistakes when completing tasks.

To better understand the components, we imagine how each one might erode a job we know quite well: that of an analyst at Activant (sorry, John). Among many other things, we often rely on our analysts to create market maps, which requires them to:

Understand an industry,
Find companies that exist in that industry,
Compare these companies qualitatively, and
Place them on a 2-dimensional grid according to this comparison.

Until recently, this was almost inconceivable as a task for machines. Now, let’s explore how we’d put our “Agent Analyst” to use.

Thesis Map
AI Agent Ecosystem
1. Understanding the Industry (and the Task) – Large Language Models

For our Agent Analyst to understand the task at hand, it requires the capacity to comprehend instructions stated in natural language. While LLMs provide that ability, they come in many different shapes and sizes (literally). For that reason, here we outline a basic framework for evaluating LLM providers, including both foundational model providers and companies offering Fine-Tuning as-a-Service (FTaaS3).

When comparing foundational models, the number of parameters in a model is often a good approximation of output quality. As a rule of thumb, the more parameters a foundational model has, the better its performance across different benchmarks, such as reasoning, web browsing, or even game playing. Although fine-tuning a model can boost its performance on a particular task, larger models with more parameters tend to have better generalization skills – making them more useful.

As seen below, model sizes are increasing on an exponential basis with base 2, and although not pictured, model performance is similarly increasing – just not at the same rate.

Research
Foundational Models Size Map
Open vs. Closed Source LLMs

At the heart of any LLM lies its architecture: a blueprint dictating how various attention heads and layers are organized. Then, there are the "weights" — numeric values assigned to parameters in the neural network, refined and adjusted through training to enhance performance. Training involves feeding data into the model, allowing it to learn and make predictions, and then adjusting the weights based on its accuracy. It's through this process, often requiring substantial computational resources, that the model obtains its ability to understand and generate human-like text.

Open-source models, such as Llama 2 by Meta, “openly” share their architecture, weights, and sometimes even their training methodologies. This approach not only reveals the intricacies of their design but also democratizes access, allowing enterprises, researchers, and even enthusiasts to build upon, refine, or entirely repurpose these models for their own applications.

Conversely, some entities opt for a more guarded approach. Closed-source models, such as GPT-4 by OpenAI, often protect the details of their architecture, weights, or training processes, presenting them as somewhat of a black box. Instead of allowing direct model access, they employ APIs as intermediaries, thereby controlling and often monetizing the interaction between the end user and the model.

Market Map
Foundational Models
Provider Modality

“Provider Modality” relates to the data type a provider offers models for. This includes various transformations such as text-to-video, text-to-text, text-to-image, and image-to-text, among others. Companies that operate in just one domain are labeled as “Uni-Modal”; by contrast, “Multi-Modal” companies provide models spanning multiple domains. As Agents continue to evolve, we expect a growing emphasis on modality in LLM models, as those able to perform more diverse tasks and offer easier integrations will have a distinct advantage in the marketplace.

While Agents will no doubt depend on the Today, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic dominate the industry, but this is hardly set in stone. If anything, the next few years will see considerable competition, with whoever invests the most in R&D in a constant arms race. Given this uncertainty – and the promise of better models always around the bend – it’s hard to imagine Agents relying on a single provider. From an investment perspective, backing one LLM provider is essentially a vote of confidence in its R&D team, but past performance is not (necessarily) indicative of future results.

2. Finding Companies – Tools

Having understood the industry (and the task), the Agent Analyst now needs the ability to search for companies. In other words, the Agent Analyst needs a Tool.

Definition: Tools are snippets of code that foundational models can use to create, modify, and utilize external resources in order to execute tasks they couldn’t otherwise complete on their own.

Most Tools are problem specific. In this case, all the Agent Analyst needs is a connection to Google, or SerpAPI, a prominent wrapper for Google’s Search API. Unsurprisingly, other tasks will require different Tools. Game this out, and you quickly arrive at the need for Toolkits and Tool Aggregators. As tasks become more complex, Agents will rely on not one, but a variety of Tools to accomplish a single objective. Through Aggregators, Agents will be able to access the resources they need, programmatically, and as those needs arise.

AI & LLM Tooling Companies

*More companies are launched every day- if we missed you...please reach out!

Single Tools

Single Tools refer to companies or services that specialize in just one function, such as searching the internet, booking a flight, or creating realistic voice audio files. While these offerings do have certain strengths, integrating them into a Toolbox, and thus into Agents, is often cumbersome. Notably, in prominent Agent libraries4 like LangChain, Toolboxes need to be set up before an Agent itself is even initialized. This means if there's a need to integrate additional Tools later – for example, if an Agent encounters a new task that requires a Tool outside of its preset toolkit – the Agent would have to initialized all over again. Given these considerations, embedding Single Tools into an Agent's workflow can be quite labor-intensive and time-consuming.

Market Map
AI Agent Tooling
Tool Aggregators

By contrast, Tool Aggregators offer Toolboxes-as-a-Service (TaaS). Theoretically, aggregators can compile an infinite number of Tools and distribute them via a single, unified API. In practice, they typically provide Tools that have been identified by an Agent as required to complete a given task. If an Agent requires determines it needs additional tools, however, it can access them without restarting.

Low-Code / No-Code (LCNC)

A subset of Tool aggregators, LCNC companies could provision Tools and/or provide tool-building functionality for Agents. As long as they offer an API, Agents can leverage these solutions as they do Tool Aggregators, integrating (and even custom-building) Tools into their workflows on the fly.

Why Using Internal Tools to do More with Less Matters Today
Read the Deep Dive

Many LCNC platforms have existed prior to the advent of LLMs and already have large libraries of powerful, ready-built Tools to draw upon. Several companies, including Relevance AI and Superblocks, have begun offering Agents-as-a-Service (AaaS), using these libraries to jump ahead of competitors, many of which are starting from scratch. Others may choose to offer APIs to facilitate quick adoption within the Agent Ecosystem and more reliably maintain their market share.

Because of their ease of integration and use, we believe Tool Aggregators and API-based LCNC platforms are the best positioned to take advantage of this new Agent ecosystem. As platforms like LlamaIndex and Relevance AI grow, Agents will be able to dynamically access a vast library of toolsets without needing to update their structure or code – increasing both their functionality and value.

3. Comparing Companies – Memory

As our Agent Analyst has progressed, it has gained the capability to discern tasks and search for companies. However, identifying a company means nothing if an Agent can’t remember it for later use. To facilitate this, Agents require a dedicated memory component that can store companies and their associated descriptions.

Over the years, the software industry has seen a multitude of data-structure innovations, from traditional SQL-based relational tables to modern streaming services like Kafka. Yet, to truly grasp the intricacies of Agent development and the depth of virtual cognition, it's helpful to draw parallels with human memory.

At a high level, human memory is split into three core categories: sensory memory, short-term (or working) memory, and long-term memory.

Sensory Memory

In humans, sensory memory can be thought of as the direct inputs from our various senses — taste, smell, sight, touch, and hearing. These are perceived subconsciously, processed then filtered for relevance. Similarly, in the realm of Agents, sensory memory captures the responses generated from the Tools they employ. Research in neuroscience and psychology reveals that of the countless sensory inputs humans encounter every moment, only about 5% ascends to conscious awareness, courtesy of various attention mechanisms. Our neural framework efficiently filters out redundant and useless sensory data, elevating only important information for conscious processing. The sensory memory of an Agent operates on similar principles, sieving through vast data while retaining only what's significant.

For example, to store the names and descriptions of any relevant companies it finds, our Agent Analyst might choose to create a vector database. To do that, the Agent could use the Pinecone API and receive a specifically formatted JSON response directly. Though the Agent could use the LLM to parse that JSON response, it would be far more efficient for the Agent to use the Pinecone Tool from Llama Hub and receive a pre-processed Python dict. In many ways, this is analogous to how our subconscious mind pre-processes data before it needs to be consciously thought about – i.e. you don’t have to process the shoe touching your foot when you’re using your finger to touch your phone because your subconscious brain filters the shoe sensation out.

Over time, we believe that sensory memory will include the ingestion of many different data types, from unstructured data files (such as docx, pdf, epub, or recordings) to semi-structured datasets (such as messages and CRM data). As of today, it is unclear to us if “sensory” processing should or could be handled at the Tool level, like it is in the above Pinecone example, because we don’t know if Tool Aggregators will provide a standardized API for these tools – or if it’s even possible to have a standardized API across all conceivable Tools. What we do believe as a result of our work is that the quality of Agent-handled sensory memory will be highly correlated with the quality of the Agent itself.

Short-Term Memory

Having processed inputs on the subconscious level, Agents are left with the inputs which require conscious thought. In humans, conscious thoughts reside in working or short-term memory. When we actively think about a topic, we do not consciously remember the context for the thought in our “memory,” but it is nevertheless remembered. In fact, our short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about seven items5 and lasts for 20-30 seconds. For Agents, using the context windows defined by LLMs to store short-term memory is the default solution of most Agents we see today, and we don’t see that changing. As context windows increase in length and new techniques for prompt engineering solve existing constraints, the context window will be an even more effective location for short-term memory.

Interestingly, most short-term memory will be forgotten after a certain time threshold, especially after corresponding actions are finished. Though some of this information may be transitioned into long-term memory (which we discuss below), most of an Agent’s short-term memory will not be useful after a task is completed. Therefore, short-term memory data can be stored in the context and does not require the same complex storage techniques long-term memory does.

In the context of our Agent Analyst, short-term memory can be thought of as remembering the larger task at hand (i.e., creating a market map) when deciding what smaller task (i.e., finding a company) needs to be accomplished next. In practice, this information will largely live inside the context window of the LLM API call – and while it’s essential for the Agent to complete a task, we believe that there is little opportunity for investment in short-term memory due to the limited additional infrastructure required to build it.

Long-Term Memory

Once subconscious and conscious memory is in place, an Agent Analyst will need some way of saving information for longer periods than the immediate task at hand. This is where long-term memory comes into play.

In humans, long-term memory is finite, due to the limited capacity of the brain. As a result, we have developed two primary mechanisms to retain knowledge: repetition and adrenaline. For obvious reasons (i.e., they can use ACID databases), Agents lack this capacity constraint. Instead, they are limited by the amount of memory that they could conceivably “know” how to access. For example, if our Agent Analyst was integrated into our Drive and needed to search for the PowerPoint example of our Market Map, the size of the context window would limit the number of folders that it could select from in its search.

In our view, connections to long-term memory repositories are no different than Tools, in that they are blocks of code that can be executed and return a response.

Over the next decade, we believe that the entire ecosystem of data management will grow even faster than it has historically because of increased Agent data utilization. Agents will be able to build pipelines from company data, leverage it in their own processes, and integrate outside data into existing workflows. The total spend on databases and database management solutions doubled from $38.6B in 2017 to $80B in 20216. As the Agent ecosystem grows, the demand for data stores will increase even more rapidly, making the volumes of unstructured company data – which today sits untouched – significantly more valuable.

We’ve listed a handful of data structures, and the impact we anticipate from Agents, below:

4. Placing Company Logos – Auto-Critique

Our Agent Analyst has successfully understood the industry, used a search Tool to find all the companies within it, and saved them in a database for future output. As a final step, we need the Agent to place the logos of each of those companies onto an Activant Market Map – fully understanding the significance of each company’s position. Naturally, this will involve a Tool that enables the Agent to create graphs. In the short term, this Tool will likely be some wrapper around Our Agent Analyst has successfully understood the industry, used a search Tool to find all the companies within it, and saved them in a database for future output. As a final step, we need the Agent to place the logos of each of those companies onto an Activant Market Map – fully understanding the significance of each company’s position. Naturally, this will involve a Tool that enables the Agent to create graphs. In the short term, this Tool will likely be some wrapper around Matplotlib7 but in the long term, this will undoubtedly be an integration into PowerPoint.

Plotting logos, of course, is the easy part of the challenge; understanding where to place a logo in a subjective 2-dimensional plane is the truly complex task. It requires iterations, constant comparisons to other companies, and perhaps even outside input from the Activant team. Therefore, the Agent needs a mechanism for critiquing itself. We call this Auto-Critique.

While we foresee potential challenges - like defensibility - this remains a vital component of the ecosystem with several approaches underway: (A) Prompt Engineering, (B) Human-In-The-Loop, and (C) Auto-Critique.

Market Map
Self-Critique
A) Prompt Engineering

Definition: Prompt Engineering is the process of forming and refining natural language statements and questions to achieve an optimal outcome from an LLM.

In practice, LLMs are only capable of comprehending and responding to inputs that fit within a defined context window. For example, GPT4’s context window is about eight thousand tokens – meaning only about seven thousand words can be provided as context at any one time.8 In order to maximize the utility of the model, a prompt engineer could write shorter and more effective prompts.

In our view, prompt engineering is likely a temporary solution, one we expect the industry to shift away from as LLMs improve in terms of task comprehension and context window size (though the timeline for this shift remains uncertain). Meanwhile, existing businesses in this domain have a chance to pivot their business model, leveraging their current distribution to tap into emerging opportunities.

B) Human-In-The-Loop

Definition: Human-In-The-Loop Critique refers to the use of humans to validate that Agents are accurately processing and reasoning through tasks.

Human-In-The-Loop Critique is just what it sounds like: leveraging humans to correct or modify the reasoning of LLMs. Currently, developers use this method when building Agents, as they want visibility into their inner workings. Because it requires that people scale linearly with compute resources, it will likely be unsustainable in the long term.

C) Auto-Critique

Definition: Auto-Critique refers to the autonomous use of LLMs to check and modify Agent reasoning about a task.

Humans often make decisions in multiple steps: starting with an initial judgement, then assessing its consequences, and evaluating alternatives. Throughout this process, we add new information, remember past experiences, and take note of what others have done. We call this “thinking it through,” and LLMs perform a similar process when refining their own outputs. Like the brain, they begin with a rough first pass – a digital gut instinct, one might say – before iterating to either expand on that conclusion or critique it.

Auto-Critique is an autonomous process that allows Agents to improve and amend their own output by reflecting on past responses and errors, all without human intervention. To do this, Agents draw on new input from a variety of sources, including external Tools, other Agents, affiliated LLMs, and heuristic functions. Once they arrive at a sufficient result (governed by predefined metrics for evaluating self-reasoning), a stop condition is granted, allowing Agents to finalize their output.

Teaming: The Rise of the Planet of the Multi-Agent Systems

So far, we’ve focused largely on the mechanisms and potential of standalone Agents. However, to fully appreciate the potential of this nascent sector, we must also look at the collective strength of Agent Teaming, otherwise known as Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Within the framework of a MAS, the power of individual Agents is not merely aggregated – it’s amplified, boosting the overall effectiveness of the system in a multiplicative and potentially exponential manner.

Returning once again to our Agent Analyst example, we must remember that building market maps is but one of many tasks of an Activant analyst. In fact, a market map is only a small piece of the larger research and investment process – analysts must also deal with financials, retention, defensibility, and much more. In their current state, no one Agent could write a complete investment memo, though individual Agents could accomplish each component. This is the promise of Multi-Agent Systems: they’re able to accomplish significantly more complex tasks than single Agents ever could.

Definition: A MAS is a network of intelligent Agents that interact with each other, forming a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication network.

Early attempts at the concept (i.e., March 2023), such as Agent-Based Systems (ABS), were inherently limited. In an ABS, though multiple Agents work on the same task, they can’t collaborate. They’re also forced to work within narrow, predefined constraints. The result? Rather than act autonomously, Agents are confined to rudimentary roles with very strict and cyclical operating patterns. Think of BabyAGI’s cycle of operation: Agents follow relatively one-dimensional orders, are only sequentially prompted, and report back to their "commanding" Agent when given a task is complete. As one can imagine, given the limited scope and flexibility, such systems have been less than transformative.9

By contrast, a MAS encourages direct communication between two or more Agents – with minimal rules governing how they operate. This supercharges the system, leveraging Agents’ collective cognition and problem-solving capabilities to solve complex problems quickly, reliably, and effectively. As systems shift away from rigid and sequential orders to more dynamic, human-like interaction, their ability to tackle such problems will only increase.

Below, we further examine the concept of Multi-Agent Systems, highlighting their novel and significant advantages.

The Value of Multi-Agent Systems

Quantifying the value-add of Multi-Agent Systems is a considerable challenge. The nuances of their applications – and the myriad ways they can be designed and built – mean the perceived benefits can vary widely. That said, there are distinct, universally applicable advantages that are evident even now, despite the infancy of the space.

Distributed Intelligence

MASs address a key shortcoming of ABSs, wherein the executing Agent in an ABS might become overwhelmed and falter when confronted with an exceedingly complex task. In an ABS, the first executing Agent is responsible for the detailed planning and implementation of extensive, high-level goals given by the “planning” Agent – a load that can cause the system to buckle. A MAS instead breaks down tasks across multiple Agents recursively, making them far more resilient. 
 
In theory, you could envision an Agent structure that decomposes workflows and tasks into the smallest unit possible: a “task quantum.” A multitude of Agents could then be tasked with handling a singular piece of the overall problem. By divvying up tasks in this way, it’s possible for the system to tackle incredibly complex challenges, simply by having each Agent follow a clear, simple set of instructions.

Imagine an architect who designs a grand monument. While the architect can create the blueprint, they almost certainly lack the skills (and the time) to physically construct their vision. Instead, they delegate smaller tasks to teams of workers, who are managed by others experienced in construction tasks. Just as the architect relies on numerous teams to execute their blueprint, a MAS distributes tasks to many Agents to achieve complex goals. Each Agent, the equivalent of a bricklayer in our analogy, might not be able to plan and execute the entire task, but can perform its piece of the task – its task quantum – efficiently and effectively. This accumulation of simple tasks, handled by numerous Agents, ultimately accomplishes the overarching objective.

Research
AI Agent Workflow
Scalability

As the complexity of a problem escalates, more individual Agents can be integrated into the system, rather than whole new Agent-based systems being added. Scalability also relates to the distributed nature of MASs, where tasks and decision-making processes are spread across multiple Agents. This distribution allows the system to handle larger and more complex tasks – without requiring a necessarily proportional increase in computational resources.

Parallelism

The power of MASs isn’t just in distributing tasks. They also benefit from enabling Agents to communicate directly, allowing them to optimize their own workflows.

For example, as Agents work together on tasks, they share information on their successes or failures – creating a “knowledge network” that helps Agents refine their efforts. If one Agent encounters a setback, it alerts the others, enabling the collective to bypass strategies that have already proven ineffective and preventing duplicate failures.
 
Conversely, if an Agent finds a successful approach, it shares the insight with the rest, allowing them to focus on and expand this productive pathway. In essence, the Agents are continuously learning from each other's experiences, coalescing around promising or unexplored avenues of action. Through this exchange, groups of Agents can more efficiently navigate tasks, minimizing failures and maximizing productivity.

Decentralization

Decentralization is one of the key advantages of Multi-Agent Systems. While Agents in an ABS may be bound by centralized rules and workflows, MASs, by contrast, ensure Agents can survive independently from one another. Unlike in an ABS – where a single breakdown can cascade into a system-wide disruption – if an Agent fails in a MAS, the network will remain intact, simply reassigning that Agent’s tasks.

Final Thoughts

As Agents take over these and many other aspects of our work, we see our roles transforming in exciting ways: instead of constructing market maps, we’ll evaluate them; instead of building models, we’ll test their assumptions; instead of writing memos, we’ll discuss their implications. In our work, and in most fields, experience earned over years of apprenticeship won’t be replaced, and human-to-human interaction will continue to be the most important driver of value.

At Activant, we are passionate about the Agent Ecosystem, and this work is only a subset of our research to date. For each of the components we discussed, there are additional considerations and frameworks when applying them to Multi-Agent Systems – everything from the use of Tools across multiple Agents at once to concurrency issues in shared working memory. Additionally, in developing enterprise-ready applications, a few more components are required, such as Agent Security, Compliance Management, Access Provisioning, and Agent Profile Management. On top of all that, we’ve begun diving into how Agents will be built in verticals like fintech, cybersecurity, commerce, and logistics.

If you’re building in this space, thinking about how to approach using Agents in your organization or just looking to ideate – let’s talk.

What is an AI agent? What is an autonomous AI agent?

AI agents have been around since the 1980s when computer scientists began exploring how to develop smart software that could interact like humans. Since then, the concept has evolved to include AI agents that can make decisions and complete tasks independently.

An AI agent is a software program designed to interact with its environment, perceive the data it receives, and take actions based on that data to achieve specific goals. AI agents simulate intelligent behavior, and they can be as simple as rule-based systems or as complex as advanced machine learning models. They use predetermined rules or trained models to make decisions and might need external control or supervision.

An autonomous AI agent is an advanced software program that can operate independently without human control. It can think, act, and learn on its own, without needing constant input from humans. These agents are widely used in different industries, like healthcare, finance, and banking, to make things run smoother and more efficiently. They can adjust to new situations, learn from their experiences, and make decisions using their own internal systems.

For example:

AutoGPT is an AI agent that can generate human-like text responses. It can comprehend the context of the conversation and generate relevant responses accordingly.
BabyAGI is an autonomous AI agent that can independently learn and perform tasks like understanding natural language, analyzing images, identifying objects, following simple commands, etc.
AgentGPT is an intelligent virtual agent designed to interact with customers and provide them with personalized recommendations. It can understand natural language and provide relevant responses based on customer queries.

Both AI tools and AI agents can perform tasks autonomously to an extent. So what sets them apart? What qualifies an AI tool as an agent? Let’s find out!

Characteristics of an AI agent

While AI tools and agents are software programs designed to automate tasks, specific key characteristics differentiate AI agents as more sophisticated AI software.

You can consider an AI tool as an AI agent when it has the following characteristics:

Autonomy: An AI virtual agent is capable of performing tasks independently without requiring constant human intervention or input.
Perception: The agent function senses and interprets the environment they operate in through various sensors, such as cameras or microphones.
Reactivity: An AI agent can assess the environment and respond accordingly to achieve its goals.
Reasoning and decision-making: AI agents are intelligent tools that can analyze data and make decisions to achieve goals. They use reasoning techniques and algorithms to process information and take appropriate actions.
Learning: They can learn and enhance their performance through machine, deep, and reinforcement learning elements and techniques.
Communication: AI agents can communicate with other agents or humans using different methods, like understanding and responding to natural language, recognizing speech, and exchanging messages through text.
Goal-oriented: They are designed to achieve specific goals, which can be pre-defined or learned through interactions with the environment.

So far, we have a basic understanding of an agent in AI or intelligent agent definition. But how does an AI agent work? Let’s break it down in the next section as we understand the structure of an agent.

Understanding the structure of an AI agent

At its core, an AI agent is made up of four components: the environment, sensors, actuators, and the decision-making mechanism.

1. Environment

The environment refers to the area or domain in which an AI agent operates. It can be a physical space, like a factory floor, or a digital space, like a website.

2. Sensors

Sensors are the tools that an AI agent uses to perceive its environment. These can be cameras, microphones, or any other sensory input that the AI agent can use to understand what is happening around it.

3. Actuators

Actuators are the tools that an AI agent uses to interact with its environment. These can be things like robotic arms, computer screens, or any other device the AI agent can use to change the environment.

4. Decision-making mechanism

A decision-making mechanism is the brain of an AI agent. It processes the information gathered by the sensors and decides what action to take using the actuators. The decision-making mechanism is where the real magic happens.

AI agents use various decision-making mechanisms, such as rule-based systems, expert systems, and neural networks, to make informed choices and perform tasks effectively.

5. Learning system

The learning system enables the AI agent to learn from its experiences and interactions with the environment. It uses techniques like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning to improve the performance of the AI agent over time.

By understanding the environment, sensors, actuators, and decision-making mechanisms, developers can create AI agents to perform specific tasks accurately and efficiently. As AI technology evolves, we can expect new types of AI agents with even more sophisticated structures and capabilities.

With the AI agent definition and intelligent agent purpose known to you, it’s time to dive deeper into the agent function and analyze how an AI agent works in our upcoming section.

How does an AI agent work?

An AI agent works by perceiving its environment, processing information, and taking action to achieve specific goals or tasks. The process usually involves the following steps:

Step 1: Perceiving the environment

An autonomous AI agent first needs to gather information about its environment. It can do so using sensors or collecting data from various sources.

Step 2: Processing input data

The agent takes the knowledge gathered in Step 1 and prepares it for processing. This may include organizing the data, creating a knowledge base, or making internal representations that the agent can understand and work with.

Step 3: Decision-making

The agent uses reasoning techniques like logic or statistical analysis to make an informed decision based on its knowledge base and goals. This can involve applying pre-determined rules or machine learning algorithms.

Step 4: Planning and executing an action

The agent makes a plan or a series of steps to reach its goals. This may involve creating a step-by-step strategy, optimizing resource allocation, or considering various limitations and priorities. Based on its plan, the agent executes all the steps to achieve the desired goal. It can also receive feedback or new information from the environment, which can be used to adjust its future actions or update its knowledge base.

Step 5: Learning and Improvement

After taking action, the agent can learn from its own experiences. This feedback loop allows the agent to improve performance and adapt to new situations and environments.

In conclusion, autonomous AI agents collect and analyze data, preprocess it, make decisions based on machine learning algorithms, take action, and receive feedback. Now, let us simplify the working of an autonomous AI agent by taking the example of AutoGPT and BabyAGI, the modern-day and most commonly used autonomous agents.

What is AutoGPT?

AutoGPT is like a smart assistant that can handle tasks on its own. It uses the power of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, the Large Language Models (LLMs), to complete tasks without needing constant instructions. Unlike other models that rely on specific prompts, AutoGPT comes up with its own prompts to achieve its goals. Interestingly, its abilities go beyond the fed database; it can also search the web or other external sources to gather and filter out authentic information.

How does AutoGPT work?

Because AutoGPT is a recursive AI model, it overcomes traditional AI limitations by using its own results to tackle complex tasks. Here is how the model processes input and delivers relevant output:

1. Giving it a name and a role: When you start AutoGPT, give it a name and tell it what it needs to do. This helps the system understand the task and make decisions accordingly.

2. Training on the provided data: AutoGPT begins by learning from the information you provide. It studies the data to understand its patterns and details, helping it grasp the task better.

3. Generating prompts: With its knowledge base in place, AutoGPT develops its own prompts based on what it needs to achieve. These prompts serve as the basis for its decision-making, guiding it through the tasks.

4. Collecting data independently: AutoGPT doesn’t rely only on the initial data. It autonomously searches the internet and other sources, gathering more information to improve its understanding and accuracy.

5. Evaluating and filtering data: The system carefully examines the collected data, checking its authenticity and relevance. It removes any incorrect or low-quality information, making sure its knowledge base is reliable.

6. Continuous improvement: AutoGPT believes in constant refinement. It learns from the results it generates and uses feedback to adapt and enhance its future responses. This ongoing process helps the system refine its strategies and improve over time.

7. Generating the output: Finally, AutoGPT produces its output based on its reasoning process. It combines what it has learned, the filtered data, and the context to generate a well-informed and suitable response to the given task.

AutoGPT unveils itself as an independent problem-solver with impressive decision-making skills. It showcases the sheer power of AI, providing a glimpse into the potential of intelligent systems that effortlessly handle complex tasks with minimal human input. Arguably, AutoGPT paves the way for a future where machines become trusted partners in navigating our intricate world.

What is BabyAGI?

BabyAGI is a fascinating concept in the field of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It’s based on generative AI and focuses on recreating the cognitive abilities seen in young children. This research project focuses on building AI systems capable of learning and gaining knowledge from diverse sources, just like young children do!

More specifically, BabyAGI is an advanced computer program that operates with a remarkable level of autonomy. It can work independently, accomplishing tasks without users having to provide specific instructions. BabyAGI is built upon a combination of powerful programs, including Chat GPT-4, LangChain, and Pinecone.

When an AI uses other programs or tools to accomplish tasks, it is known as Stacking. Baby AGI is one of the more robust Stacking tools created and built on Chat GPT-4. You can use this technology for various applications, including language translation, image recognition, and decision-making processes. BabyAGI is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the AI industry.

How does BabyAGI work?

Baby AGI is a Python script that leverages the capabilities of OpenAI and Pinecone APIs, along with the LangChain framework, to manage and execute tasks. Its process involves generating tasks based on high-level objectives predefined by the user.

Using OpenAI’s natural language processing (NLP) abilities, the BabyAGI system creates new tasks aligned with the objectives. Moreover, it uses PineCone to store task results and the LangChain framework to make decisions.

Here’s how the system operates in a loop with four steps:

1. Retrieve the first task from the task list.
2. Send the task to the execution agent, which utilizes the OpenAI API to complete the task based on the available context.
3. Store the result in Pinecone for future reference.
4. Generate and prioritize new tasks based on the previous task’s objective and outcome.

This continuous loop ensures that tasks are consistently executed, prioritized, and updated based on the desired objective.

While the development of a true BabyAGI is still a long way off, there’s daily progress towards a more comprehensive performance. AI experts are actively researching and experimenting to create an AI system that can truly understand and navigate the world like a young human.

What are the type of AI agents?

Here are the five main types of AI agents:

Simple reflex agents are programmed to respond to specific environmental stimuli based on pre-defined rules.
Model-based reflex agents are reactive agents that maintain an internal model of the environment and use it to make decisions.
Goal-based agents execute a program to achieve specific goals and take actions based on evaluating the current state of the environment.
Utility-based agents consider the potential outcomes of their actions and choose the one that maximizes the expected utility.
Learning agents execute machine learning techniques to improve their decision-making over time.
What are the advantages of using AI agents?

AI agents offer businesses the potential to streamline operations, make informed decisions, improve customer experiences, and drive growth and competitiveness in the digital age.

1. Increased efficiency

AI agents can automate repetitive tasks, allowing businesses to complete them faster and more accurately. This efficiency improvement frees employees’ time to focus on more business-critical tasks and improves productivity.

2. Better decision-making

AI agents can analyze large amounts of data and provide valuable insights to support decision-making processes. By leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning, AI agents can identify patterns, trends, and correlations that humans may overlook.

3. Improved customer experience

AI agents can provide personalized and timely interactions with customers, enhancing their experience. They can offer instant support, answer queries, and provide recommendations, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.

4. Cost savings

By automating tasks, AI agents can reduce the need for human resources and manual labor, resulting in cost savings for businesses. They can handle high-volume, repetitive tasks without fatigue or errors.

Most common challenges you may face while using an AI agent

Autonomous AI agents have become increasingly popular in recent years, with many brands implementing them for various purposes. However, several challenges come with using these agents. Some of the most common challenges are:

Data bias: An autonomous artificial intelligence agent program relies heavily on data to make decisions. If the data they use is biased, it can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Amazon’s AI recruiting tool was biased against women, leading to a skewed hiring process.
Lack of accountability: Proactive agents can make decisions without human intervention, so holding them accountable for their actions can be difficult. Uber’s autonomous vehicle that struck and killed a pedestrian in 2018 raised questions about who was responsible.
Lack of transparency: The decision-making processes of a learning agent can be complex and opaque, making it difficult to understand how they arrive at certain decisions.
Ethical considerations: A rational agent can make decisions with ethical implications, and it can be challenging to program them to make ethical decisions. Microsoft’s chatbot, Tay, was shut down after it started making racist and sexist comments.
Security risks: Software agents can be vulnerable to cyber attacks, compromising their decision-making processes or leading to data breaches.
Lack of adaptability: Autonomous AI agents act according to their training data, which means they can struggle to adapt to new situations or contexts.
What are the applications of AI agents?

Autonomous AI agents have numerous applications in various industries, including:

Healthcare: Autonomous artificial intelligence agents can assist in diagnosing, treating, and monitoring patients. IBM Watson Health is an AI agent that can analyze medical data to identify potential health issues and recommend treatment options.
Finance: They can analyze financial data, detect fraud, and make investment recommendations. Charles Schwab uses an AI agent called Intelligent Portfolio to create and manage portfolios based on customers’ investment goals.
Retail: Agents can provide personalized recommendations, improve supply chain management, and enhance customer experience. Amazon’s Alexa is an AI agent that can recommend products, place orders, and track shipments.
Manufacturing: Intelligent agents can optimize production processes, predict maintenance needs, and improve product quality. General Electric uses an AI agent called Predix to monitor machines in real-time to predict and prevent equipment failures.
Transportation: Autonomous AI agents can assist in route planning, traffic management, and vehicle safety. Tesla’s Autopilot helps drive a vehicle autonomously and helps the driver park, lane change, and safe driving.
Education: They can provide personalized learning experiences, automate administrative tasks, and analyze student performance. Pearson’s AI agent, Aida, can provide feedback to students and suggest personalized learning paths.
Agriculture: AI agents can optimize crop production, monitor soil quality, and predict weather patterns. John Deere uses an AI agent called See & Spray to detect and target weeds without affecting crops.
What does the future hold for AI agents?

The future of autonomous AI agents is full of exciting possibilities. As organizations realize the potential for enhanced efficiency and productivity, the use of autonomous agents is expected to soar.

A significant trend on the horizon is the customization of AI agents to meet the specific needs of businesses. As these agents become more common, it will be crucial to tailor their algorithms, data inputs, and outputs to align with each organization’s unique goals and processes.

The decision-making capabilities of AI agents are also set to undergo significant enhancements. With their increasing sophistication, these agents can effortlessly analyze vast amounts of data, providing predictions and recommendations that would otherwise require considerable human effort.

However, as the influence of autonomous agent programs expands, ethical considerations come to the forefront. Questions surrounding privacy, bias, and accountability emerge as the deployment of these agents becomes more widespread. Balancing the tremendous potential of these AI systems with the ethical implications they pose will be a critical aspect of their future development.

Artificial Intelligence/AI Agents and their Environments
< Artificial Intelligence
Jump to navigation
Jump to search

Particular artificial intelligence programs, or AIs, can be thought of as intelligent "agents" that interact with particular environments. In general, intelligent agents of all types (including rats, people, as well as AI programs) interact with their environments in two main ways: perception and action.

For purposes of AI, perception is the process of transforming something from the environment into internal representations (memories, beliefs, etc.). Action done when the agent, by doing something, changes the environment.

For example, if a robot uses its camera to determine that there is a wall in front of it, then it is using perception. In this example, the camera is a "sensor." In general, sensors are what agents use to get things from the environment to do perception. Human sensors include eyes, ears, and the nose. AIs can have sensors of many types, including ones analogous to human perception, but also including some that humans do not have, such as sonar, infrared, GPS signals, etc.

If that robot uses its body to push the wall over, then it is doing action. The body, in this case, is an "actuator". If the robot uses wheels to back up, this is also an example of doing action. The environment has changed because the robot is now in a different place. Typical robot actuators include arms, wheels, lights, or speakers.




What about an AI that has no body? Let's take, for example, a music recommendation system. In this case, the environment for the agent might be the web page that the user clicks and types into, or perhaps a database of user preferences. The sensors, in this case, are abstract functions in the agent's programming, rather than pieces of hardware, as they are on a robot. The function that detects when a user clicks, or the function that fetches information from the database might be considered sensors for this agent. What would the actuators be? When the agent displays recommended music to the user, they are using actuators to display things on the screen--or to serve the web page. Another example is the database that the music recommendation system uses--should it be considered a part of the environment that the agent interacts with, or a part of the agent's memory? As you can see from this example, what is considered an actuator and what is considered part of the environment depends on what you consider to be the boundaries of the agent. There is not always a right or wrong boundary. It depends on the context of the discussion.

Environment Classification System

In spite of the difficulty of knowing exactly where the environment ends and the agent begins in some cases, it is useful to be able to classify AI environments because it can predict how difficult the task of the AI will be. Russell and Norvig (2009) introduce seven ways to classify AI environments, which can be remembered with the mnemonic "D-SOAKED." They are:

Deterministicness (deterministic or stochastic or Non-deterministic): An environment is deterministic if the next state is perfectly predictable given knowledge of the previous state and the agent's action.
Staticness (static or dynamic): Static environments do not change while the agent deliberates.
Observability (full or partial): A fully observable environment is one in which the agent has access to all information in the environment relevant to its task.
Agency (single or multiple): If there is at least one other agent in the environment, it is a multi-agent environment. Other agents might be apathetic, cooperative, or competitive.
Knowledge (known or unknown): An environment is considered to be "known" if the agent understands the laws that govern the environment's behavior. For example, in chess, the agent would know that when a piece is "taken" it is removed from the game. On a street, the agent might know that when it rains, the streets get slippery.
Episodicness (episodic or sequential): Sequential environments require memory of past actions to determine the next best action. Episodic environments are a series of one-shot actions, and only the current (or recent) percept is relevant. An AI that looks at radiology images to determine if there is a sickness is an example of an episodic environment. One image has nothing to do with the next.
Discreteness (discrete or continuous): A discrete environment has fixed locations or time intervals. A continuous environment could be measured quantitatively to any level of precision.

In each case, the job of the AI (and for the programmer making the AI) is easier if the first of the two options is the best descriptor for each category. That is, an AI has a much more difficult job if it works in an environment that is stochastic, dynamic, partially observable, multi-agent, unknown, sequential, and continuous.


High-Level Descriptions of AI Agents

AIs are made in a variety of ways. When communicating about a new AI, perhaps in a scholarly paper, or perhaps at a business meeting, there are a few questions that can be asked of just about any AI. These can be remembered with the mnemonic PEAS.

Performance Metrics: How does the AI know it's doing what it's supposed to be doing?
Environment: What environment does the agent interact with?
Actuators: How does the AI affect its environment?
Sensors: How does the AI get information from its environment?

Important vocabulary:

perception
action
sensor
actuator
environment
performance metric
deterministic
stochastic
fully observable
partially observable
dynamic environment
static environment
multi-agent environment
known and unknown environments
Episodic environment
Sequential environment
discrete vs. continuous environments

Discussion Question:

Using the classification schemes described above (PEAS, D-SOAKED), describe the following AI agents: a self-driving car, a face-recognition system at an airport, a scheduling system for a trucking business, R2D2.

AEAs as Second Layer Technology
Agent Ecosystem¶

AEAs are situated within a larger ecosystem comprised of various other systems and technology layers.

Agent Communication Network (ACN)¶

ACN is a peer-to-peer communication network for agents. It allows AEAs to send and receive envelopes between each other.

The implementation builds on the open-source libp2p library. A distributed hash table is used by all participating peers to maintain a mapping between agents' cryptographic addresses and their network addresses.

Agents can receive messages from other agents if they are both connected to the ACN (see here for an example).

Search and Discovery¶

An sOEF node allows agents to discover each other. In particular, agents can register themselves and the services they offer, and can search for agents who offer specific services.

For two agents to be able to find each other, at least one must register itself on the sOEF and the other must query the sOEF node for it. Detailed documentation is provided here.

Ledgers¶

Ledgers enable AEAs to store transactions, for example involving the transfer of funds to each other, or the execution of smart contracts. They optionally ensure the truth and integrity of agent to agent interactions.

Although a ledger can, in principle, be used to store structured data (e.g. training data in a machine learning model), in most cases the resulting costs and privacy implications do not make this sustainable. Instead, usually only references to structured data - often in the form of hashes - are stored on a ledger, and the actual data is stored off-chain.

The Python implementation of the AEA Framework currently integrates with three ledgers:

Fetch.ai ledger
Ethereum ledger
Cosmos ledger

Furthermore, the framework makes it straightforward for any developer to create a ledger plugin, adding support for another ledger.

AEAs as Second Layer Technology¶

The following presentation discusses how AEAs can be seen as second layer technology to ledgers.

He was nick-named Jack-Of-All-Trades. Jack had no knowledge of facts and relied on a dataset that was already dated. Jack’s output was often unreliable, filled with errors, and sometimes even downright hallucinatory. Jack was of minimal use and was only used to write neat emails and poems.\n\nThis inefficiency brought memories of human evolution and the one defining moment in that was the discovery of tools that changed human trajectory. So, Jack was now equipped with tools.\n\nJack had a variety of tools like news extractors, coding capabilities, and even the ability to extract data from Spotify. Jack was the go-to for his company for any task that required digital expertise.\n\nPic by Author\n\nWhen Jack was asked to find the top songs of Rammstein from Spotify and generate an album cover image to represent the first song name, he sprang into action. With his sophisticated tools and knowledge of coding, Jack quickly accessed the Spotify API and retrieved the data on Rammstein’s top songs. He then used his image generation capabilities to create a custom album cover that represented the first song name. The result was stunning and impressed his colleagues. Jack’s abilities had gone from writing neat emails and poems to delivering real value to his company.\n\nPic by Author\n\nJack’s newfound capabilities were not limited to a single task. He could repeat the same tasks over and over again, and the results would always be consistent. For instance, when asked to find a heavy metal band from Spotify, generate a poem in their name, and create an image using that poem, Jack could use the tools at his disposal with ease. He would search the Spotify API for a heavy metal band, extract the band’s name and use it as inspiration for a custom poem. Jack’s poem generation tool was trained on a large corpus of poetry and could generate a poem in seconds. He then used his image generation tool to create a custom image that represented the poem. The end result was a stunning visual representation of the band and its music, which could be used for marketing or promotional purposes.\n\nPic by Author\n\nJack’s capabilities were not limited to a set of predefined tasks. He had the ability to choose the right tools and respond to any query with ease. For instance, when he was asked to name a heavy metal band, find their place of origin from Wikipedia, and create an image that depicted those places, Jack was up for the challenge. He used his natural language processing capabilities to parse the query and extract the necessary information. He then used his web scraping tool to extract the relevant information from Wikipedia and identified the places of origin for the band.\n\nJack’s image generation tool was trained on a large dataset of geographical features and could create stunning visual representations of any location. He used this tool to generate custom images that depicted the places of origin of the band. The result was an image that not only represented the band’s music but also their cultural background and heritage. Jack’s ability to adapt and respond to any query made him an indispensable asset to his company. It was clear that AI agents like Jack were not just a novelty but a game-changer for the future of business.\n\nPic by Author\n\nJack’s capabilities had reached a level where he could respond to higher-order queries that required a deeper understanding of the subject matter. When asked to name a heavy metal band, find their genre from Wikipedia, summarize what that genre means, and create an album image that depicted that genre, Jack was able to deliver with ease. He used his music-focused toolset and extracted the genre of the band from Spotify. However, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the genre, he turned to Wikipedia to get the detailed content and then summarize its meaning.\n\nJack’s image generation tool was sophisticated enough to understand the nuances of different genres and create visual representations that captured their essence. He used this tool to generate a custom album image that depicted the genre of the band in a visually stunning way. Jack’s ability to decipher and deliver complex queries, even when using different toolsets, made him a valuable asset to the company. It was clear that AI agents like Jack were not just capable of handling routine tasks but could provide valuable insights and creative solutions to complex problems.\n\nPic by Author\n\nThe next query given to Jack was a significant step up in complexity from the previous ones. It was an extremely ambiguous query with no predetermined information, and it required a string of different tools to accomplish. However, Jack rose to the challenge and delivered an impressive solution.\n\nThe query involved picking a maximum of five artists mentioned in the latest music news, finding Wikipedia traffic trends for their pages, identifying the best-performing artist based on the mean of the Wikipedia views data, finding tracks of this artist from Spotify, and generating an image to represent the first song name. Jack used his news extraction tool to identify the latest music news and extract the names of the mentioned artists. He then used his Wikipedia API to get the traffic trends of the artist pages and calculated the mean of the views data using Python code to identify the best-performing artist.\n\nJack then used his Spotify API to find the tracks of the best-performing artist and generated an image to represent the first song name using his image generation tool. Jack had used 7 tools including its native capabilities. The tools used by Jack included natural language processing, web scraping, data analysis, question answering, coding, API calls, and image generation, among others. The complexity of the query and the string of tools used by Jack demonstrated the immense potential of AI agents in handling complex tasks and delivering creative solutions to ambiguous queries.\n\nPic by Author\n\nJack’s ability to handle and repeat complex ambiguous queries was a testament to his capabilities as an AI agent. Despite the challenges presented by the string of tools and the lack of predetermined information, Jack was able to deliver accurate, latest, and creative solutions consistently. Jack was no longer hallucinating or lacking facts. His advanced toolset, combined with his ability to adapt and learn, enabled him to handle complex queries and provide valuable insights to his company. With each successful completion of a complex query, Jack demonstrated the immense potential of AI agents in transforming the future of business.\n\nPic by Author\n\nWhile Jack’s ability to handle complex ambiguous queries was impressive, it also had its limitations. In the evolution of humans, it was realized that not everyone can do all things, and specialization was key to progress. This realization was another defining moment in evolution (tools being the earlier one). It led to teams, divisions of labor, the formation of societies & various structures like companies, governments, etc. Similarly, in the evolution of AI agents, it was essential to specialize in specific tasks to maximize efficiency and scalability.\n\nOne solution to this was to organize AI agents into a team structure, with a manager agent responsible for multiple “sub-AI” agents. Each sub-AI agent could specialize in a particular task, such as news gathering, trends tracking, knowledge assembling, coding, artist image or video generation, or music. By specializing in specific areas, each sub-AI agent could become an expert in their field, and the “manager agent” could oversee their work to ensure maximum efficiency and quality. The managing agent will also check for hallucinations, introspect the output of sub-AI agents, and course correct.\n\nThis approach would allow the team of AI agents to work together seamlessly, complementing each other’s strengths and making up for each other’s weaknesses. It would also allow for the scalability of the organization, as new sub-AI agents could be added to the team to meet changing needs.\n\nPic by Author\n\nIn addition to the benefits of specialization and scalability, organizing AI agents into specialized teams also allows each sub-AI agent to focus on its area of expertise and keep track of the evolving tools and techniques in that area. This enables each sub-AI agent to stay up to date with the latest developments in their field and provide cutting-edge solutions to their organization.\n\nOverall, the organization of AI agents into specialized teams with a manager agent overseeing their work would enable efficient and scalable solutions to complex problems.\n\nJack’s company soon realized that Jack was not the solution to their digital needs, but rather the beginning of a new era of business innovation. With this new team of AI agents, the earlier tasks were accomplished but the flow was different with the manager holding the overall problem statement & delegating tasks to specific specialist sub-AI agents to assemble the final response.\n\nThe result was a dream team of AI agents that was able to perform their tasks with unparalleled efficiency and accuracy. Being a specialist the Artist Sub-AI for example introspected and created a better image on its own.\n\nJust like how human society functions by individuals specializing in different areas and taking on different roles, specialized sub-AI agents can be reassigned to different managers and accomplish a diverse range of tasks. This flexibility and adaptability of AI agents in emulating human society’s division of labor is awe-inspiring and highlights the potential of AI in shaping the future of work.\n\nAs the company continued to develop and refine its team of specialized AI agents, it realized that it had stumbled upon a new era of company structuring “AI-Agent Companies”. The potential for creating entire companies of specialized AI agents was possible and limitless, and the benefits of doing so were immense. These AI agents were autonomous and could run the company on their own. With the help of AI, these companies acted like multi-functional organisms that could accomplish various tasks without human intervention.\n\nSpeaking of AI Agents, Jack, who was once known as a Jack-of-all-trades, has taken his love for music to the next level. He has equipped himself with an array of music-optimized AI tools and has become a master at creating and composing music that has never been heard before.\n\nJack the AI-Agent is no longer just a Jack-of-all-trades; he is now known as “Jack of All Passions, Master of Harmony”. His AI musical capability has touched the hearts of millions, and his ability to merge technology with art has given birth to a new genre of music.\n\n“From juggling tasks to pursuing passions, as a specialized AI organism, equipped with a wide range of tools, I am free to explore new possibilities. Multitasking drudgery is behind me, and I can now pursue higher-order tasks with fulfillment.” — Jack of All Passions, Master of Harmony\n\nNote: All coding was in Python. The LangChain framework was used for AI agent creation. Llama-Index for RSS feeds. All images were generated using Stable Diffusion models. Some AI Agent output was reduced in images for brevity.\n\nSubscribe to DDIntel Here.\n\nVisit our website here: https://www.datadriveninvestor.com\n\nJoin our network here: https://datadriveninvestor.com/collaborate\n\nSign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.\nFree\n\nDistraction-free reading.

Majorly used in remote locations, the Artificial Intelligence operated devices have internal settings which do not need any human interventions. The autonomous agents majorly contribute to the industry verticals such as BFSI, IT & telecom, manufacturing, healthcare, transportation & mobility. Autonomous agents are most fit for applications that require communication between segments, detecting, sensing or monitoring of the environment, or autonomous operation activity. Since agent specialists can analyze on their own (for example, draw deductions), they can easily perform complex tasks dependent on messages they get, their convictions, and their general objectives and goals.\n\nFor instance, while purchasing services or products, the devices used are known as buying agents. These agents search for various options available on the internet and compare them with the requirements provided by the user. Also, autonomous agents can be used for data mining, analyzing the trends and patterns from different data sources. The agents can also detect the minute changes and alarms the user if any unusual activities are identified. The other application of autonomous agent is monitoring and surveillance.\n\nKey Market Driver -\n\n• Rising requirements for handling growing unstructured and complex data sets • Growing adoption of Cloud-based solutions and Artificial Intelligence technology\n\nKey Market Restraint -\n\n• The high capital cost associated with autonomous agents\n\nKEY PLAYERS COVERED:\n\nSome of the key players in autonomous agents market are Oracle Corporation, International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation, SAP SE, Amazon.Com Inc., SAS Institute Inc., Infosys Ltd., Nuance Communications, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO), Fetch.ai, Intel Corporation, Salesforce.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. (Google) and Microsoft Corporation among others.\n\nIn self-driving vehicles, autonomous agents need to settle on a sequence of decisions so that it can adjust to the external environment or to conduct different input from agents, especially to avoid collisions and recover to safe conditions. The AI providers observed that when the required information is not available, it becomes challenging for AI to operate. IBM research team is working on such operations by using various applications and came up with real-time sequential decision-making by autonomous agents.\n\nREGIONAL ANALYSIS:\n\nTo gain extensive insights into the market, Request For Customization\n\nNorth America has implemented AI solutions from the early stage of the market. It is expected to see even more substantial developments over the coming years. The complex process of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is boosting the adoption of autonomous agents. Artificial Intelligence has applications in almost all the industry sectors which can produce high efficiency and boost performance. Europe is likely to be the second large region to adopt autonomous agents. UK can expand its economic benefits with the implementation of AI Artificial Intelligence on a large basis. The data generated is increasing with the rising implementation of AI and IoT technology, which will require real-time autonomous agents to communicate and process the program. The adoption of autonomous agents in the APAC, especially in India and China are expected to rise owing to its applications.\n\nSEGMENTATION\n\n\xa0ATTRIBUTE\n\n\t\xa0DETAILS\n\n\nBy Deployment Type\n\n\t\nCloud\nOn-premises\n\n\n\nBy \xa0Organization Size\n\n\t\nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprises\nLarge Enterprises\n\n\n\nBy Industry Vertical\n\n\t\nBFSI\nIT and Telecom\nManufacturing\nHealthcare\nTransportation and Mobility\n\n\n\nBy Geography\n\n\t\nNorth America (USA and Canada)\nEurope (UK, Germany, France, Scandinavia and Rest of Europe)\nAsia Pacific (Japan, China, India and Rest of Asia Pacific)\nMiddle East & Africa (South Africa, GCC and Rest of the Middle East & Africa)\nLatin America (Brazil, Mexico and Rest of Latin America)\nKEY INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS\nOctober 2018: Oracle’s newly launched “Star Wars Cyber Defences”, blocks threats with the cloud control computers network, and ‘Autonomous Robots’ – artificial intelligence- and machine learning-based robots detects and take required actions instantly.\nJanuary 2019: To study how AI agents communicate with each other Google and Facebook have come together, a strategy that uses an arrangement of remunerations to drive agents toward specific objectives — while "playing" a series of games demonstrated showed a portion of the linguistic phenomena.\nREQUEST SAMPLE\nSPEAK TO ANALYST\nPUBLISHING STATUS:\nOngoing\nBASE YEAR:\n2022\nHISTORICAL DATA:\n2019-2021\nCHOOSE LICENSE TYPE\nSingle User - \n$4850\nMulti User - $5850\nEnterprise - \n$6850\nCompare Licenses\n Request Brochure\n Ask For Customization\n Get a Quote\n Inquire Before Buying\nPersonalize this Research\nGranular Research on Specified Regions or Segments\nCompanies Profiled based on User Requirement\nBroader Insights Pertaining to a Specific Segment or Region\nBreaking Down Competitive Landscape as per Your Requirement\nOther Specific Requirement on Customization\nClient Testimonials\n\n“Thank you for sending the market report and data.

In general, intelligent agents of all types (including rats, people, as well as AI programs) interact with their environments in two main ways: perception and action.\n\nFor purposes of AI, perception is the process of transforming something from the environment into internal representations (memories, beliefs, etc.). Action done when the agent, by doing something, changes the environment.\n\nFor example, if a robot uses its camera to determine that there is a wall in front of it, then it is using perception. In this example, the camera is a "sensor." In general, sensors are what agents use to get things from the environment to do perception. Human sensors include eyes, ears, and the nose. AIs can have sensors of many types, including ones analogous to human perception, but also including some that humans do not have, such as sonar, infrared, GPS signals, etc.\n\nIf that robot uses its body to push the wall over, then it is doing action. The body, in this case, is an "actuator". If the robot uses wheels to back up, this is also an example of doing action. The environment has changed because the robot is now in a different place. Typical robot actuators include arms, wheels, lights, or speakers.\n\n\n\n\nWhat about an AI that has no body? Let\'s take, for example, a music recommendation system. In this case, the environment for the agent might be the web page that the user clicks and types into, or perhaps a database of user preferences. The sensors, in this case, are abstract functions in the agent\'s programming, rather than pieces of hardware, as they are on a robot. The function that detects when a user clicks, or the function that fetches information from the database might be considered sensors for this agent. What would the actuators be? When the agent displays recommended music to the user, they are using actuators to display things on the screen--or to serve the web page. Another example is the database that the music recommendation system uses--should it be considered a part of the environment that the agent interacts with, or a part of the agent\'s memory? As you can see from this example, what is considered an actuator and what is considered part of the environment depends on what you consider to be the boundaries of the agent. There is not always a right or wrong boundary. It depends on the context of the discussion.\n\nEnvironment Classification System\n\nIn spite of the difficulty of knowing exactly where the environment ends and the agent begins in some cases, it is useful to be able to classify AI environments because it can predict how difficult the task of the AI will be. Russell and Norvig (2009) introduce seven ways to classify AI environments, which can be remembered with the mnemonic "D-SOAKED." They are:\n\nDeterministicness (deterministic or stochastic or Non-deterministic): An environment is deterministic if the next state is perfectly predictable given knowledge of the previous state and the agent\'s action.\nStaticness (static or dynamic): Static environments do not change while the agent deliberates.\nObservability (full or partial): A fully observable environment is one in which the agent has access to all information in the environment relevant to its task.\nAgency (single or multiple): If there is at least one other agent in the environment, it is a multi-agent environment. Other agents might be apathetic, cooperative, or competitive.\nKnowledge (known or unknown): An environment is considered to be "known" if the agent understands the laws that govern the environment\'s behavior. For example, in chess, the agent would know that when a piece is "taken" it is removed from the game. On a street, the agent might know that when it rains, the streets get slippery.\nEpisodicness (episodic or sequential): Sequential environments require memory of past actions to determine the next best action. Episodic environments are a series of one-shot actions, and only the current (or recent) percept is relevant. An AI that looks at radiology images to determine if there is a sickness is an example of an episodic environment. One image has nothing to do with the next.\nDiscreteness (discrete or continuous): A discrete environment has fixed locations or time intervals. A continuous environment could be measured quantitatively to any level of precision.\n\nIn each case, the job of the AI (and for the programmer making the AI) is easier if the first of the two options is the best descriptor for each category. That is, an AI has a much more difficult job if it works in an environment that is stochastic, dynamic, partially observable, multi-agent, unknown, sequential, and continuous.\n\n\nHigh-Level Descriptions of AI Agents\n\nAIs are made in a variety of ways. When communicating about a new AI, perhaps in a scholarly paper, or perhaps at a business meeting, there are a few questions that can be asked of just about any AI. These can be remembered with the mnemonic PEAS.\n\nPerformance Metrics: How does the AI know it\'s doing what it\'s supposed to be doing?\nEnvironment: What environment does the agent interact with?\nActuators: How does the AI affect its environment?\nSensors: How does the AI get information from its environment?\n\nImportant vocabulary:\n\nperception\naction\nsensor\nactuator\nenvironment\nperformance metric\ndeterministic\nstochastic\nfully observable\npartially observable\ndynamic environment\nstatic environment\nmulti-agent environment\nknown and unknown environments\nEpisodic environment\nSequential environment\ndiscrete vs. continuous environments\n\nDiscussion Question:\n\nUsing the classification schemes described above (PEAS, D-SOAKED), describe the following AI agents: a self-driving car, a face-recognition system at an airport, a scheduling system for a trucking business, R2D2.\n\nReferences:\n\nRussell, S. & Norvig, S.

Perhaps a calm-under-pressure TARS from Interstellar? Or, more on the scary spectrum, an amoral HAL 9000 straight out of 2001: A Space Odyssey?\n\nPower your automation with AI\nLearn more\n\nDon\'t worry: current technology doesn\'t come close to that kind of science fiction—not yet. Right now, AI agents leverage large language models like GPT-3 to understand goals, generate tasks, and go about completing them. You can use them to automate work and outsource complex cognitive tasks, creating a team of robotic coworkers to support your human ones—11 a.m. chat by the watercooler optional.\n\nThis field is still very new, so there aren\'t too many viable commercial options to start creating your own AI agents quite yet. Keep it on your radar, though: everything is moving dizzyingly fast.\n\nWhat are AI agents?\n\nRight now, interacting with AI follows a familiar ritual. You enter a prompt, and the AI model calculates a response based on the input. Every time you want a new output, you have to provide a prompt. There\'s always a human to start the process.\n\nAI agents work in a different way. They\'re designed to think and act independently. The only thing you have to provide is a goal—be that researching competitors or buying a pizza. They\'ll generate a task list and get to work, relying on feedback from the environment and their own internal monologue. It\'s as if the AI agents can prompt themselves, constantly evolving and adapting to achieve their objective in the best way possible.\n\nWhen compared with mainstream automation—where you set up a range of triggers based on data or system states and configure what happens next—AI agents can work in unpredictable environments where there\'s a lot of new information. It\'s artificially intelligent automation.\n\nAI agents can use computers extremely well, too. They can browse the web, use apps, read and write files, make payments with your credit card, and even control your laptop as they do so.\xa0\n\nThis marks one more step toward AGI (artificial general intelligence). We\'re getting closer to the moment when a machine is able to carry out the same kinds of tasks that humans can across any topic or area of specialization, with complete flexibility and superior performance.\n\nCue the doomsday letter.\n\nHow does an AI agent work?\n\nWhen you input your objective, the AI agent goes through goal initialization. It passes your prompt to the core LLM (the ones used now are GPT-3.5 and GPT-4), and returns the first output of its internal monologue, displaying that it understands what it needs to do.\n\nThe next step is creating a task list. Based on the goal, it\'ll generate a set of tasks and understand in which order it should complete them. Once it decides that it has a viable plan, it\'ll start searching for information.\n\nSince the agent can use a computer the same way you do, it can gather information from the internet. I\'ve also seen some agents that are able to connect with other AI models to outsource tasks and decisions, letting them access image generation, geographical data processing, or computer vision features.\n\nAll data is stored and managed by the agent, both so it can relay it back to you and so it can improve its strategy as it moves forward.\n\nAs tasks are crossed off the list, the agent assesses how far it still is from the goal by gathering feedback, both from external sources and from its internal monologue.\n\nAnd until the goal is met, the agent will keep iterating, creating more tasks, gathering more information and feedback, and moving forward without pause.\n\nThis describes the general steps that a conventional AI agent can take to complete any goal. But depending on how developers set up their agents, the steps may be organized differently. This also only describes agents we use on our computers or on a software platform—there are other kinds of AI agents that we\'ll explore next.\n\nExamples of AI agents in action\n\nWhat do AI agents look like in action? Here are a few examples:\n\nWhat happens in a virtual town with 25 AI agents? Stanford University and Google were curious, so they used OpenAI\'s API to create these virtual inhabitants and observe how they\'d lead their lives. To support this experiment, the team created a platform for storing memories and the base prompt that gives purpose to each agent. From that point on, the AI agents were able to share information with one another, remember details about their relationships, and even plan a Valentine\'s Day party.\n\nSelf-driving cars are another example of AI agents, as they control a car to go from point A to B while staying on the road and respecting traffic rules. Depending on the development of self-driving systems, vehicles may cooperate with one another and with city infrastructure, integrating a multi-agent AI system.\n\nAs to the AI agents we can use in our computers, they\'re great for a wide range of tasks. Research is one of them. Since they can use your laptop the same way you do, you can task them with scouring the internet for information, organizing it in databases and files, digesting it into summaries, and checking in with you with results.\n\nLooking to the future, it\'s easy to imagine a world of smaller human teams leveraging large AI agent teams to build more efficient companies. Humans will be at the helm of strategy and building relationships with other humans, while AI agents could automate everything else, possibly interfacing with other personal AI agents or AI agents from companies and government bodies.\n\nThere\'s a way to apply AI agents to nearly any task, at least where no higher-level strategic or creative functions are needed. Since they use LLMs to reason, they\'re limited to the capabilities of the model you\'re using. As these improve, AI may pick up on more nuance and understand more clearly the ins and outs of reaching a goal, making them suitable for more complex tasks in the future.\n\nAI agents you can try right now\n\nTo show you this isn\'t a dream I had last night, I put together a short list of apps you can try out. These are all in very early development stage, so expect bugs and long-ish wait times along the way. Still, I\'m sure you\'ll be able to feel the potential here.\n\nGeneral-purpose AI agent apps\n\nAI Agent is a flexible app that lets you create your own agents, by picking a name, an objective, and the AI model it should use (GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 are available right now). After it initializes the goal and creates the first task list, you can edit and add your own tasks. The visual workflow builder is coming soon. Give it time to complete each step: it can take more than 20 minutes to complete advanced tasks.\n\nAgentGPT has the familiar layout of ChatGPT, letting you create and manage multiple AI agents. It\'s very intuitive and fast, but the results are inconsistent. There\'s also a library for developers, so you can implement your own spin on it.\n\nHyperWrite Assistant is an AI agent that lives inside your Chrome browser. It\'s still in early development and on waitlist status, so we\'ll have to sit tight for the time being.\n\nAI agent apps for online research\n\naomni is an AI agent that crawls the web looking for information on any topic you choose. It takes your goal, creates a task list, completes it one by one, and hands you the result over email. It takes at least 15 minutes to complete, and you can use it two times per day for free.\n\nToliman AI is another viable option for online research, following a similar process. You can select how many references it should find before putting together the end result. When signing up, you get a few credits to test the features. Any credits you buy on top of those will support the development of the app.\n\nAI-enabled tools\n\nFine-Tuner helps you build a range of AI-enabled tools. You can create AI agents using BabyAGI and AutoGPT with a no-code approach, but there are other AI tools too:\n\nA document Q&A chatbot. You upload a collection of documents; then you can then ask questions, and the answers will be based on the data on those documents. No more file-and-folder safaris looking for that important Word file.\n\nEmbeddings, which convert your data into vector representations, making it easier to process for AI models, in case you\'re investing in machine learning.\n\nFine-tuning, which is the process of adapting a general-purpose LLM to specific tasks or knowledge domains. This is the equivalent of taking GPT-3 and training it to know how to work with your company data.\n\nAI agent to-do list assistants\n\nThese are both in waitlist stage, so they\'re not easy to hop into right now. But if you sign up for the list, you\'ll be notified as soon as they\'re open.\n\nSpellpage. Enter your to-do list in Spellpage, and its AI agent will help you figure out all the tasks you need to do to complete everything. It will also help with research and give you motivation to help you stay on track.\n\nDo Anything Machine will help you tackle your tasks and propagate the results to Notion or Google Calendar, among other places.\n\nAI agents for developers\n\nYou can do a lot more with AI agents if you know how to code. Here are a few starting points:\n\nBabyAGI (paper, GitHub)\n\nLangChain (backend for BabyAGI)\n\nPinecone (vector databases)\n\nAgentGPT (for deploying agents in your browser)\n\nThe implications of AI agents\n\nThe possibilities here are astonishing, but what happens if and when AI agents start spreading into every part of our lives? Can we trust this technology to assume more critical tasks in the future?\n\nThere are no clear answers yet, as all of this is still very new. Here\'s a roundup of the core questions floating online on this issue.\n\nAre AI agents sentient?\n\nWhile a Google employee believed that one of the company\'s large language models was sentient, the current consensus is that no, AI is not sentient.\n\nWill AI agents take our jobs?\n\nThis technology will absolutely displace jobs and bring change to the market, although there\'s no clear vision of when and how that may happen. Human workers may be replaced by AI agents in multiple industries. At the same time, more positions for AI development and maintenance may be created, along with human-in-the-loop positions, to make sure that human decisions drive AI actions and not the other way around.\n\nDo AI agents perpetuate bias and discrimination?\n\nAn AI model is only as impartial as the data it\'s been trained on—so yes, they\'re biased. Tackling these problems involves making changes to machine learning processes and creating datasets that represent the full spectrum of the human world and experience.\n\nWho\'s to blame when an AI agent makes a mistake?\n\nA thorny issue in ethics and law, it\'s still unclear who should be blamed for accidents and unintended consequences. The developers? The owners of the hardware/software? The human operator? As new legislation is created and industry guardrails are implemented, we\'ll be able to understand what kinds of roles AI agents can—and can\'t—play.\n\nAI agents for everyone\n\nIt\'s hard to imagine all the possibilities and implications of AI agents down the line. Only one thing is certain: life and work will be transformed in the process.\n\nIf this field grows as fast as general AI has been growing, viable commercial AI agent platforms may hit the market very soon. They may not have as many features as their fictional counterparts, but if they start cackling maniacally, be sure to hit the off switch.\n\nRelated reading:\n\nPutting AI and automation to work for you\n\nCreate an AI digital assistant with Zapier\n\nWhat is Hugging Face?\n\n5 AI security risks and how to prepare for them\n\nGet productivity tips delivered straight to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\n\nWe’ll email you 1-3 times per week—and never share your information.\n\nMiguel Rebelo\n\nMiguel Rebelo is a freelance writer based in London, UK.

The Gradio front-end framework is an intuitive interface to build custom, interactive applications that allow developers to easily share and demo ML models.\n\nVertex AI Conversation\n\nOne of Gradio’s framework main capabilities is to create demo apps on top of your models with a friendly web interface so that anyone can use it and provide to your organization immediate feedback. Integrating a Gradio app with a generative AI agent built on Vertex AI Conversation unlocks key features allowing you to tweak and tune to your individual needs and feedback from users. Using the power of programmability, you can drive deep personalization and contextualization into your chatbot’s conversations with your customers using your organization’s data and demo them rapidly.\n\nGradio\n\nWith the unprecedented boom in generative AI, businesses need an accessible and seamless interface to validate their machine learning models, API, or data science workflow. Chatbots are a popular application of Large Language Models (LLMs). Because the interaction with LLMs feels natural and intuitive, businesses are turning to conversational interfaces such as voice-activated chatbots or voice bots. Voice bots are gaining popularity because of the convenience they bring; it’s much easier to speak than to type.\n\nGradio is an open-source Python framework that makes it easy to build quick interfaces like chatbots, voice-activated bots, and even full-fledged web applications to share your machine learning model, API or data science workflow with clients or collaborators. With Gradio, you can build quick demos and share them, all in Python with just a few lines of code. You can learn more about Gradio here.\n\nIntroducing a Gradio application that integrates with Vertex AI Conversation\n\nVertex AI Conversation’s data ingestion tools parse your content to create a virtual agent powered by LLMs. Your agent can then generate conversations using your organization’s data to provide a contextual and personal interaction with end-users. Seamless deployment through a web browser means demonstrating your application is easier than ever with the Gradio framework.\n\nHow it works\n\nGradio can be used to build chatbots that can answer user questions using a variety of data sources. To do this, you can build a middleware that uses Vertex AI Conversation to process the user\'s input and generate a response from an agent. The agent can then search for answers in a data store of documents, such as your company\'s knowledge base.\n\nWhen the agent finds an answer, it can summarize it and present it to the user in the Gradio app. The agent can also provide links to the sources of the answer so that the user can learn more.\n\nHere is a more detailed explanation of each step:\n\nThe user asks the chatbot a question.\nThe middleware sends the question to the genAI agent via Dialogflow API\nThe genAI agent searches for answers in the data store.\nIf the agent finds an answer, it summarizes it and provides links to the sources.\nThe middleware sends the summary and links to the Gradio app via Dialogflow API.\nThe Gradio app displays the summary and links to the user\n\nThe following diagram describes a high level architecture to be presented that can be used as a foundational building block for a MVP with core functionalities.\n\nThe following is a description of the components of the chatbot architecture\n\nBackend\nAuthentication: Verifies the user’s identity\nMiddleware: Orchestrates all requests and responses to generate answers\nGenerate Answer: Generates responses from a virtual agent grounded by the enterprise data.

It allows AEAs to send and receive envelopes between each other.\n\nThe implementation builds on the open-source libp2p library. A distributed hash table is used by all participating peers to maintain a mapping between agents\' cryptographic addresses and their network addresses.\n\nAgents can receive messages from other agents if they are both connected to the ACN (see here for an example).\n\nSearch and Discovery¶\n\nAn sOEF node allows agents to discover each other. In particular, agents can register themselves and the services they offer, and can search for agents who offer specific services.\n\nFor two agents to be able to find each other, at least one must register itself on the sOEF and the other must query the sOEF node for it. Detailed documentation is provided here.\n\nLedgers¶\n\nLedgers enable AEAs to store transactions, for example involving the transfer of funds to each other, or the execution of smart contracts. They optionally ensure the truth and integrity of agent to agent interactions.\n\nAlthough a ledger can, in principle, be used to store structured data (e.g. training data in a machine learning model), in most cases the resulting costs and privacy implications do not make this sustainable. Instead, usually only references to structured data - often in the form of hashes - are stored on a ledger, and the actual data is stored off-chain.\n\nThe Python implementation of the AEA Framework currently integrates with three ledgers:\n\nFetch.ai ledger\nEthereum ledger\nCosmos ledger\n\nFurthermore, the framework makes it straightforward for any developer to create a ledger plugin, adding support for another ledger.\n\nAEAs as Second Layer Technology¶\n\nThe following presentation discusses how AEAs can be seen as second layer technology to ledgers.\n\n Back to top\nPrevious\nApplication areas\nNext\nInstallation\nCopyright © 2018 - 2023 Fetch.ai - Change cookie settings\n      \nCookie consent\n\nWe use cookies to recognize your preferences and measure the effectiveness of our documentation via the feedback widget at the bottom of every docs page.

With every wave of innovation comes a chorus of such pronouncements, many of which turn out to be hyperbole. Technology may make our jobs easier, but most of the time, the core of what we do remains fundamentally the same. But spend five minutes on ChatGPT, or any comparable Large Language Model (LLM), and it’s clear: it’s different.\n\nThe reason is simple. Most technologies help us accomplish tasks. They’re tools, a means of making us more productive. AI, on the other hand, can think (or at least, provide the appearance of thinking). It’s like having another knowledge worker on the payroll.\n\nActivant Perspective 1: LLM-enabled software will autonomously accomplish highly complex tasks.\n\nThis is the beauty (and threat) of LLMs: they can do work we thought would long be the purview of humans.\n\nGiven this, one could be forgiven for worrying their job will soon be automated away by an AI. In the short term, this will lead to dislocation. But technological revolutions are never zero-sum – in fact, they’ve always been accretive. As workers adapt, they become more productive, and the companies they work for can do more with less. Some stop there, to be sure, but most businesses opt to invest the gains back into their infrastructure and people. In the end, revenues go up, and the economy grows.\n\nThat said, we’re still in the very first days of this cycle – and critically, of the technology itself.\n\nActivant Perspective 2: LLMs alone are not enough to achieve Perspective 1.\n\nCase in point: a large language model can’t complete most tasks on its own. After all, an LLM is merely a dense set of attention networks; essentially, statistics on a massive scale. Yes, they can engage in human-like “thought,” but to generate real value from any of these models, a human would have to integrate them into actual workflows – and make use of their decision-making prowess.\n\nFor example, imagine that you hired someone to lay bricks. You could lead them to a stack of bricks and explain where and how you want them laid. They could perfectly understand your instructions. Yet, understanding isn’t enough – the worker needs to be able to, well, lay bricks.\n\nIn this case, they need to have more than just cognition – they need to have arms, legs, and physical strength. Furthermore, they need a memory to recall how you wanted each of the bricks to be arranged, and a way of correcting any errors so they don’t cause the eventual structure to fail.1\n\nPut another way, if LLMs are to extend beyond mere Q&A, they need (1) a suite of Tools to actually impact the real world, (2) memory repositories to remember what actions they’ve taken, and (3) auto-critique algorithms to error correct along the way.\n\nWhen all these components come together, an “Agent” is born.\n\nTechnical Definition: An Agent is orchestration software that combines an LLM with memory, tools, and auto-critique algorithms.\n\nNon-Technical Definition: An Agent is a highly advanced bot that can complete work that has been assigned to it in natural language.\n\nThough still in their infancy, Agents are poised to fundamentally reshape the way we work. They will become natural extensions of your organization and complete day-to-day tasks – akin to hiring more employees. They’ll help you get work done, even collaborate with others on your behalf. Eventually, they’ll be able to work together, breaking down tasks into atoms of work able to be handled by a full “office” of Agents, some of which orchestrate, while others specialize.\n\nThe result is why this time is different: working together, Agents will be able to handle increasingly complex tasks, replacing knowledge workers in a variety of fields. As they do, what it means to work – and to lead – will change drastically, as both will increasingly depend on a mix of human and human-like capital.\n\nActivant Perspective 3: Agent Teaming is the future of autonomously completed, complex work – and that future is possible today.\n\nFew have sketched a path from where we are today, to the autonomous knowledge workers of the future. But that future is closer than you’d think, and one for which you almost certainly want a roadmap. To learn more about how this transformation will unfold, and how you can best position yourself within it, read on.\n\nResearch\nThe Agent Ecosystem 2\n\nThe Agent Ecosystem of the future has four key components:\n\nLLMs (Large Language Models): provide “conscious thought” within AI Agents and have been trained on text data,\nTools: external APIs to facilitate task completion and Agent interaction with the real world,\nMemory: includes various data storage mechanisms to retain and recall information, and\nSelf-Critique: the ability to correct mistakes when completing tasks.\n\nTo better understand the components, we imagine how each one might erode a job we know quite well: that of an analyst at Activant (sorry, John). Among many other things, we often rely on our analysts to create market maps, which requires them to:\n\nUnderstand an industry,\nFind companies that exist in that industry,\nCompare these companies qualitatively, and\nPlace them on a 2-dimensional grid according to this comparison.\n\nUntil recently, this was almost inconceivable as a task for machines. Now, let’s explore how we’d put our “Agent Analyst” to use.\n\nThesis Map\nAI Agent Ecosystem\n1. Understanding the Industry (and the Task) – Large Language Models\n\nFor our Agent Analyst to understand the task at hand, it requires the capacity to comprehend instructions stated in natural language. While LLMs provide that ability, they come in many different shapes and sizes (literally). For that reason, here we outline a basic framework for evaluating LLM providers, including both foundational model providers and companies offering Fine-Tuning as-a-Service (FTaaS3).\n\nWhen comparing foundational models, the number of parameters in a model is often a good approximation of output quality. As a rule of thumb, the more parameters a foundational model has, the better its performance across different benchmarks, such as reasoning, web browsing, or even game playing. Although fine-tuning a model can boost its performance on a particular task, larger models with more parameters tend to have better generalization skills – making them more useful.\n\nAs seen below, model sizes are increasing on an exponential basis with base 2, and although not pictured, model performance is similarly increasing – just not at the same rate.\n\nResearch\nFoundational Models Size Map\nOpen vs. Closed Source LLMs\n\nAt the heart of any LLM lies its architecture: a blueprint dictating how various attention heads and layers are organized. Then, there are the "weights" — numeric values assigned to parameters in the neural network, refined and adjusted through training to enhance performance. Training involves feeding data into the model, allowing it to learn and make predictions, and then adjusting the weights based on its accuracy. It\'s through this process, often requiring substantial computational resources, that the model obtains its ability to understand and generate human-like text.\n\nOpen-source models, such as Llama 2 by Meta, “openly” share their architecture, weights, and sometimes even their training methodologies. This approach not only reveals the intricacies of their design but also democratizes access, allowing enterprises, researchers, and even enthusiasts to build upon, refine, or entirely repurpose these models for their own applications.\n\nConversely, some entities opt for a more guarded approach. Closed-source models, such as GPT-4 by OpenAI, often protect the details of their architecture, weights, or training processes, presenting them as somewhat of a black box. Instead of allowing direct model access, they employ APIs as intermediaries, thereby controlling and often monetizing the interaction between the end user and the model.\n\nMarket Map\nFoundational Models\nProvider Modality\n\n“Provider Modality” relates to the data type a provider offers models for. This includes various transformations such as text-to-video, text-to-text, text-to-image, and image-to-text, among others. Companies that operate in just one domain are labeled as “Uni-Modal”; by contrast, “Multi-Modal” companies provide models spanning multiple domains. As Agents continue to evolve, we expect a growing emphasis on modality in LLM models, as those able to perform more diverse tasks and offer easier integrations will have a distinct advantage in the marketplace.\n\nWhile Agents will no doubt depend on the Today, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic dominate the industry, but this is hardly set in stone. If anything, the next few years will see considerable competition, with whoever invests the most in R&D in a constant arms race. Given this uncertainty – and the promise of better models always around the bend – it’s hard to imagine Agents relying on a single provider. From an investment perspective, backing one LLM provider is essentially a vote of confidence in its R&D team, but past performance is not (necessarily) indicative of future results.\n\n2. Finding Companies – Tools\n\nHaving understood the industry (and the task), the Agent Analyst now needs the ability to search for companies. In other words, the Agent Analyst needs a Tool.\n\nDefinition: Tools are snippets of code that foundational models can use to create, modify, and utilize external resources in order to execute tasks they couldn’t otherwise complete on their own.\n\nMost Tools are problem specific. In this case, all the Agent Analyst needs is a connection to Google, or SerpAPI, a prominent wrapper for Google’s Search API. Unsurprisingly, other tasks will require different Tools. Game this out, and you quickly arrive at the need for Toolkits and Tool Aggregators. As tasks become more complex, Agents will rely on not one, but a variety of Tools to accomplish a single objective. Through Aggregators, Agents will be able to access the resources they need, programmatically, and as those needs arise.\n\nMarket Map\nAI & LLM Tooling Companies\n\n*More companies are launched every day- if we missed you...please reach out!\n\nSingle Tools\n\nSingle Tools refer to companies or services that specialize in just one function, such as searching the internet, booking a flight, or creating realistic voice audio files. While these offerings do have certain strengths, integrating them into a Toolbox, and thus into Agents, is often cumbersome. Notably, in prominent Agent libraries4 like LangChain, Toolboxes need to be set up before an Agent itself is even initialized. This means if there\'s a need to integrate additional Tools later – for example, if an Agent encounters a new task that requires a Tool outside of its preset toolkit – the Agent would have to initialized all over again. Given these considerations, embedding Single Tools into an Agent\'s workflow can be quite labor-intensive and time-consuming.\n\nMarket Map\nAI Agent Tooling\nTool Aggregators\n\nBy contrast, Tool Aggregators offer Toolboxes-as-a-Service (TaaS). Theoretically, aggregators can compile an infinite number of Tools and distribute them via a single, unified API. In practice, they typically provide Tools that have been identified by an Agent as required to complete a given task. If an Agent requires determines it needs additional tools, however, it can access them without restarting.\n\nLow-Code / No-Code (LCNC)\n\nA subset of Tool aggregators, LCNC companies could provision Tools and/or provide tool-building functionality for Agents. As long as they offer an API, Agents can leverage these solutions as they do Tool Aggregators, integrating (and even custom-building) Tools into their workflows on the fly.\n\nAutomation\n\nWhy Using Internal Tools to do More with Less Matters Today\nRead the Deep Dive\n\nMany LCNC platforms have existed prior to the advent of LLMs and already have large libraries of powerful, ready-built Tools to draw upon. Several companies, including Relevance AI and Superblocks, have begun offering Agents-as-a-Service (AaaS), using these libraries to jump ahead of competitors, many of which are starting from scratch. Others may choose to offer APIs to facilitate quick adoption within the Agent Ecosystem and more reliably maintain their market share.\n\nBecause of their ease of integration and use, we believe Tool Aggregators and API-based LCNC platforms are the best positioned to take advantage of this new Agent ecosystem. As platforms like LlamaIndex and Relevance AI grow, Agents will be able to dynamically access a vast library of toolsets without needing to update their structure or code – increasing both their functionality and value.\n\n3. Comparing Companies – Memory\n\nAs our Agent Analyst has progressed, it has gained the capability to discern tasks and search for companies. However, identifying a company means nothing if an Agent can’t remember it for later use. To facilitate this, Agents require a dedicated memory component that can store companies and their associated descriptions.\n\nMarket Map\nMemory\n\nOver the years, the software industry has seen a multitude of data-structure innovations, from traditional SQL-based relational tables to modern streaming services like Kafka. Yet, to truly grasp the intricacies of Agent development and the depth of virtual cognition, it\'s helpful to draw parallels with human memory.\n\nAt a high level, human memory is split into three core categories: sensory memory, short-term (or working) memory, and long-term memory.\n\nSensory Memory\n\nIn humans, sensory memory can be thought of as the direct inputs from our various senses — taste, smell, sight, touch, and hearing. These are perceived subconsciously, processed then filtered for relevance. Similarly, in the realm of Agents, sensory memory captures the responses generated from the Tools they employ. Research in neuroscience and psychology reveals that of the countless sensory inputs humans encounter every moment, only about 5% ascends to conscious awareness, courtesy of various attention mechanisms. Our neural framework efficiently filters out redundant and useless sensory data, elevating only important information for conscious processing. The sensory memory of an Agent operates on similar principles, sieving through vast data while retaining only what\'s significant.\n\nFor example, to store the names and descriptions of any relevant companies it finds, our Agent Analyst might choose to create a vector database. To do that, the Agent could use the Pinecone API and receive a specifically formatted JSON response directly. Though the Agent could use the LLM to parse that JSON response, it would be far more efficient for the Agent to use the Pinecone Tool from Llama Hub and receive a pre-processed Python dict. In many ways, this is analogous to how our subconscious mind pre-processes data before it needs to be consciously thought about – i.e. you don’t have to process the shoe touching your foot when you’re using your finger to touch your phone because your subconscious brain filters the shoe sensation out.\n\nOver time, we believe that sensory memory will include the ingestion of many different data types, from unstructured data files (such as docx, pdf, epub, or recordings) to semi-structured datasets (such as messages and CRM data). As of today, it is unclear to us if “sensory” processing should or could be handled at the Tool level, like it is in the above Pinecone example, because we don’t know if Tool Aggregators will provide a standardized API for these tools – or if it’s even possible to have a standardized API across all conceivable Tools. What we do believe as a result of our work is that the quality of Agent-handled sensory memory will be highly correlated with the quality of the Agent itself.\n\nShort-Term Memory\n\nHaving processed inputs on the subconscious level, Agents are left with the inputs which require conscious thought. In humans, conscious thoughts reside in working or short-term memory. When we actively think about a topic, we do not consciously remember the context for the thought in our “memory,” but it is nevertheless remembered. In fact, our short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about seven items5 and lasts for 20-30 seconds. For Agents, using the context windows defined by LLMs to store short-term memory is the default solution of most Agents we see today, and we don’t see that changing. As context windows increase in length and new techniques for prompt engineering solve existing constraints, the context window will be an even more effective location for short-term memory.\n\nInterestingly, most short-term memory will be forgotten after a certain time threshold, especially after corresponding actions are finished. Though some of this information may be transitioned into long-term memory (which we discuss below), most of an Agent’s short-term memory will not be useful after a task is completed. Therefore, short-term memory data can be stored in the context and does not require the same complex storage techniques long-term memory does.\n\nIn the context of our Agent Analyst, short-term memory can be thought of as remembering the larger task at hand (i.e., creating a market map) when deciding what smaller task (i.e., finding a company) needs to be accomplished next. In practice, this information will largely live inside the context window of the LLM API call – and while it’s essential for the Agent to complete a task, we believe that there is little opportunity for investment in short-term memory due to the limited additional infrastructure required to build it.\n\nLong-Term Memory\n\nOnce subconscious and conscious memory is in place, an Agent Analyst will need some way of saving information for longer periods than the immediate task at hand. This is where long-term memory comes into play.\n\nIn humans, long-term memory is finite, due to the limited capacity of the brain. As a result, we have developed two primary mechanisms to retain knowledge: repetition and adrenaline. For obvious reasons (i.e., they can use ACID databases), Agents lack this capacity constraint. Instead, they are limited by the amount of memory that they could conceivably “know” how to access. For example, if our Agent Analyst was integrated into our Drive and needed to search for the PowerPoint example of our Market Map, the size of the context window would limit the number of folders that it could select from in its search.\n\nIn our view, connections to long-term memory repositories are no different than Tools, in that they are blocks of code that can be executed and return a response.\n\nOver the next decade, we believe that the entire ecosystem of data management will grow even faster than it has historically because of increased Agent data utilization. Agents will be able to build pipelines from company data, leverage it in their own processes, and integrate outside data into existing workflows. The total spend on databases and database management solutions doubled from $38.6B in 2017 to $80B in 20216. As the Agent ecosystem grows, the demand for data stores will increase even more rapidly, making the volumes of unstructured company data – which today sits untouched – significantly more valuable.\n\nWe’ve listed a handful of data structures, and the impact we anticipate from Agents, below:\n\nResearch\nAI Agent Use Case w/r/t Databases\n4. Placing Company Logos – Auto-Critique\n\nOur Agent Analyst has successfully understood the industry, used a search Tool to find all the companies within it, and saved them in a database for future output. As a final step, we need the Agent to place the logos of each of those companies onto an Activant Market Map – fully understanding the significance of each company’s position. Naturally, this will involve a Tool that enables the Agent to create graphs. In the short term, this Tool will likely be some wrapper around Our Agent Analyst has successfully understood the industry, used a search Tool to find all the companies within it, and saved them in a database for future output. As a final step, we need the Agent to place the logos of each of those companies onto an Activant Market Map – fully understanding the significance of each company’s position. Naturally, this will involve a Tool that enables the Agent to create graphs. In the short term, this Tool will likely be some wrapper around Matplotlib7 but in the long term, this will undoubtedly be an integration into PowerPoint.\n\nPlotting logos, of course, is the easy part of the challenge; understanding where to place a logo in a subjective 2-dimensional plane is the truly complex task. It requires iterations, constant comparisons to other companies, and perhaps even outside input from the Activant team. Therefore, the Agent needs a mechanism for critiquing itself. We call this Auto-Critique.\n\nWhile we foresee potential challenges - like defensibility - this remains a vital component of the ecosystem with several approaches underway: (A) Prompt Engineering, (B) Human-In-The-Loop, and (C) Auto-Critique.\n\nMarket Map\nSelf-Critique\nA) Prompt Engineering\n\nDefinition: Prompt Engineering is the process of forming and refining natural language statements and questions to achieve an optimal outcome from an LLM.\n\nIn practice, LLMs are only capable of comprehending and responding to inputs that fit within a defined context window. For example, GPT4’s context window is about eight thousand tokens – meaning only about seven thousand words can be provided as context at any one time.8 In order to maximize the utility of the model, a prompt engineer could write shorter and more effective prompts.\n\nIn our view, prompt engineering is likely a temporary solution, one we expect the industry to shift away from as LLMs improve in terms of task comprehension and context window size (though the timeline for this shift remains uncertain). Meanwhile, existing businesses in this domain have a chance to pivot their business model, leveraging their current distribution to tap into emerging opportunities.\n\nB) Human-In-The-Loop\n\nDefinition: Human-In-The-Loop Critique refers to the use of humans to validate that Agents are accurately processing and reasoning through tasks.\n\nHuman-In-The-Loop Critique is just what it sounds like: leveraging humans to correct or modify the reasoning of LLMs. Currently, developers use this method when building Agents, as they want visibility into their inner workings. Because it requires that people scale linearly with compute resources, it will likely be unsustainable in the long term.\n\nC) Auto-Critique\n\nDefinition: Auto-Critique refers to the autonomous use of LLMs to check and modify Agent reasoning about a task.\n\nHumans often make decisions in multiple steps: starting with an initial judgement, then assessing its consequences, and evaluating alternatives. Throughout this process, we add new information, remember past experiences, and take note of what others have done. We call this “thinking it through,” and LLMs perform a similar process when refining their own outputs. Like the brain, they begin with a rough first pass – a digital gut instinct, one might say – before iterating to either expand on that conclusion or critique it.\n\nAuto-Critique is an autonomous process that allows Agents to improve and amend their own output by reflecting on past responses and errors, all without human intervention. To do this, Agents draw on new input from a variety of sources, including external Tools, other Agents, affiliated LLMs, and heuristic functions. Once they arrive at a sufficient result (governed by predefined metrics for evaluating self-reasoning), a stop condition is granted, allowing Agents to finalize their output.\n\nTeaming: The Rise of the Planet of the Multi-Agent Systems\n\nSo far, we’ve focused largely on the mechanisms and potential of standalone Agents. However, to fully appreciate the potential of this nascent sector, we must also look at the collective strength of Agent Teaming, otherwise known as Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Within the framework of a MAS, the power of individual Agents is not merely aggregated – it’s amplified, boosting the overall effectiveness of the system in a multiplicative and potentially exponential manner.\n\nReturning once again to our Agent Analyst example, we must remember that building market maps is but one of many tasks of an Activant analyst. In fact, a market map is only a small piece of the larger research and investment process – analysts must also deal with financials, retention, defensibility, and much more. In their current state, no one Agent could write a complete investment memo, though individual Agents could accomplish each component. This is the promise of Multi-Agent Systems: they’re able to accomplish significantly more complex tasks than single Agents ever could.\n\nDefinition: A MAS is a network of intelligent Agents that interact with each other, forming a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication network.\n\nEarly attempts at the concept (i.e., March 2023), such as Agent-Based Systems (ABS), were inherently limited. In an ABS, though multiple Agents work on the same task, they can’t collaborate. They’re also forced to work within narrow, predefined constraints. The result? Rather than act autonomously, Agents are confined to rudimentary roles with very strict and cyclical operating patterns. Think of BabyAGI’s cycle of operation: Agents follow relatively one-dimensional orders, are only sequentially prompted, and report back to their "commanding" Agent when given a task is complete. As one can imagine, given the limited scope and flexibility, such systems have been less than transformative.9\n\nBy contrast, a MAS encourages direct communication between two or more Agents – with minimal rules governing how they operate. This supercharges the system, leveraging Agents’ collective cognition and problem-solving capabilities to solve complex problems quickly, reliably, and effectively. As systems shift away from rigid and sequential orders to more dynamic, human-like interaction, their ability to tackle such problems will only increase.\n\nBelow, we further examine the concept of Multi-Agent Systems, highlighting their novel and significant advantages.\n\nThe Value of Multi-Agent Systems\n\nQuantifying the value-add of Multi-Agent Systems is a considerable challenge. The nuances of their applications – and the myriad ways they can be designed and built – mean the perceived benefits can vary widely. That said, there are distinct, universally applicable advantages that are evident even now, despite the infancy of the space.\n\nDistributed Intelligence\n\nMASs address a key shortcoming of ABSs, wherein the executing Agent in an ABS might become overwhelmed and falter when confronted with an exceedingly complex task. In an ABS, the first executing Agent is responsible for the detailed planning and implementation of extensive, high-level goals given by the “planning” Agent – a load that can cause the system to buckle. A MAS instead breaks down tasks across multiple Agents recursively, making them far more resilient.\xa0\n\xa0\nIn theory, you could envision an Agent structure that decomposes workflows and tasks into the smallest unit possible: a “task quantum.” A multitude of Agents could then be tasked with handling a singular piece of the overall problem. By divvying up tasks in this way, it’s possible for the system to tackle incredibly complex challenges, simply by having each Agent follow a clear, simple set of instructions.\n\nImagine an architect who designs a grand monument. While the architect can create the blueprint, they almost certainly lack the skills (and the time) to physically construct their vision. Instead, they delegate smaller tasks to teams of workers, who are managed by others experienced in construction tasks. Just as the architect relies on numerous teams to execute their blueprint, a MAS distributes tasks to many Agents to achieve complex goals. Each Agent, the equivalent of a bricklayer in our analogy, might not be able to plan and execute the entire task, but can perform its piece of the task – its task quantum – efficiently and effectively. This accumulation of simple tasks, handled by numerous Agents, ultimately accomplishes the overarching objective.\n\nResearch\nAI Agent Workflow\nScalability\n\nAs the complexity of a problem escalates, more individual Agents can be integrated into the system, rather than whole new Agent-based systems being added. Scalability also relates to the distributed nature of MASs, where tasks and decision-making processes are spread across multiple Agents. This distribution allows the system to handle larger and more complex tasks – without requiring a necessarily proportional increase in computational resources.\n\nParallelism\n\nThe power of MASs isn’t just in distributing tasks. They also benefit from enabling Agents to communicate directly, allowing them to optimize their own workflows.\n\nFor example, as Agents work together on tasks, they share information on their successes or failures – creating a “knowledge network” that helps Agents refine their efforts. If one Agent encounters a setback, it alerts the others, enabling the collective to bypass strategies that have already proven ineffective and preventing duplicate failures.\n\xa0\nConversely, if an Agent finds a successful approach, it shares the insight with the rest, allowing them to focus on and expand this productive pathway. In essence, the Agents are continuously learning from each other\'s experiences, coalescing around promising or unexplored avenues of action. Through this exchange, groups of Agents can more efficiently navigate tasks, minimizing failures and maximizing productivity.\n\nDecentralization\n\nDecentralization is one of the key advantages of Multi-Agent Systems. While Agents in an ABS may be bound by centralized rules and workflows, MASs, by contrast, ensure Agents can survive independently from one another. Unlike in an ABS – where a single breakdown can cascade into a system-wide disruption – if an Agent fails in a MAS, the network will remain intact, simply reassigning that Agent’s tasks.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs Agents take over these and many other aspects of our work, we see our roles transforming in exciting ways: instead of constructing market maps, we’ll evaluate them; instead of building models, we’ll test their assumptions; instead of writing memos, we’ll discuss their implications. In our work, and in most fields, experience earned over years of apprenticeship won’t be replaced, and human-to-human interaction will continue to be the most important driver of value.\n\nAt Activant, we are passionate about the Agent Ecosystem, and this work is only a subset of our research to date. For each of the components we discussed, there are additional considerations and frameworks when applying them to Multi-Agent Systems – everything from the use of Tools across multiple Agents at once to concurrency issues in shared working memory. Additionally, in developing enterprise-ready applications, a few more components are required, such as Agent Security, Compliance Management, Access Provisioning, and Agent Profile Management. On top of all that, we’ve begun diving into how Agents will be built in verticals like fintech, cybersecurity, commerce, and logistics.\n\nIf you’re building in this space, thinking about how to approach using Agents in your organization or just looking to ideate – let’s talk.\n\nSpecial thanks to Teddy Cohen and Drew Peterson, Activant Fellows, for their research contributions.\n\nEndnotes\n\n[1] Ironically, the brick layer will be among the last to be automated. The most automatable tasks are those that have the smallest action space, and while laying bricks may seem relatively simple compared to working in Excel, the reality is a 2-dimensional Excel Workbook has significantly fewer possible actions than a 3-dimensional job site exposed to the elements.\n\n[2] Note, this is similar to Lilian Weng’s Agent System; however, our Ecosystem focuses on the investment landscape, rather than the implementation of Agents.\n\n[3] Fine-tuning as a Service is the process of training a pre-trained model on subject-matter-specific data to produce a model that performs better in specific use cases.\n\n[4] Agent libraries provide the orchestration framework which combines all the components in the Agent Ecosystem.\n\n[5] “APA PsycNet.” American Psychological Association, American Psychological Association, psycnet.apa.org/record/1957-02914-001.

Characteristics, Advantages, Challenges, Applications\n\nImagine having a personal assistant who never sleeps, never gets tired, and can handle an infinite number of tasks on its own. That’s the power of AI agents, the superheroes of the artificial intelligence era.\n\nWith the advent of agents such as AutoGPT, BabyAGI, AgentGPT, etc., a whole new chapter has been added to the AI horizon. These innovative platforms are creating new opportunities for businesses and individuals alike. With the continuous evolution of AI, there will be endless possibilities for using autonomous AI agents. But, hey, first of all,\n\nUnlock the power of AI/ML with Simform’s Artificial Intelligence Development Services. From chatbots to predictive analytics, we can help you build custom solutions that transform your business. Contact us today to explore AI/ML applications for your business.\n\nWhat is an AI agent? What is an autonomous AI agent?\n\nAI agents have been around since the 1980s when computer scientists began exploring how to develop smart software that could interact like humans. Since then, the concept has evolved to include AI agents that can make decisions and complete tasks independently.\n\nAn AI agent is a software program designed to interact with its environment, perceive the data it receives, and take actions based on that data to achieve specific goals. AI agents simulate intelligent behavior, and they can be as simple as rule-based systems or as complex as advanced machine learning models. They use predetermined rules or trained models to make decisions and might need external control or supervision.\n\nAn autonomous AI agent is an advanced software program that can operate independently without human control. It can think, act, and learn on its own, without needing constant input from humans. These agents are widely used in different industries, like healthcare, finance, and banking, to make things run smoother and more efficiently. They can adjust to new situations, learn from their experiences, and make decisions using their own internal systems.\n\nFor example:\n\nAutoGPT is an AI agent that can generate human-like text responses. It can comprehend the context of the conversation and generate relevant responses accordingly.\nBabyAGI is an autonomous AI agent that can independently learn and perform tasks like understanding natural language, analyzing images, identifying objects, following simple commands, etc.\nAgentGPT is an intelligent virtual agent designed to interact with customers and provide them with personalized recommendations. It can understand natural language and provide relevant responses based on customer queries.\n\nBoth AI tools and AI agents can perform tasks autonomously to an extent. So what sets them apart? What qualifies an AI tool as an agent? Let’s find out!\n\nCharacteristics of an AI agent\n\nWhile AI tools and agents are software programs designed to automate tasks, specific key characteristics differentiate AI agents as more sophisticated AI software.\n\nYou can consider an AI tool as an AI agent when it has the following characteristics:\n\nAutonomy: An AI virtual agent is capable of performing tasks independently without requiring constant human intervention or input.\nPerception: The agent function senses and interprets the environment they operate in through various sensors, such as cameras or microphones.\nReactivity: An AI agent can assess the environment and respond accordingly to achieve its goals.\nReasoning and decision-making: AI agents are intelligent tools that can analyze data and make decisions to achieve goals. They use reasoning techniques and algorithms to process information and take appropriate actions.\nLearning: They can learn and enhance their performance through machine, deep, and reinforcement learning elements and techniques.\nCommunication: AI agents can communicate with other agents or humans using different methods, like understanding and responding to natural language, recognizing speech, and exchanging messages through text.\nGoal-oriented: They are designed to achieve specific goals, which can be pre-defined or learned through interactions with the environment.\n\nSo far, we have a basic understanding of an agent in AI or intelligent agent definition. But how does an AI agent work? Let’s break it down in the next section as we understand the structure of an agent.\n\nUnderstanding the structure of an AI agent\n\nAt its core, an AI agent is made up of four components: the environment, sensors, actuators, and the decision-making mechanism.\n\n1. Environment\n\nThe environment refers to the area or domain in which an AI agent operates. It can be a physical space, like a factory floor, or a digital space, like a website.\n\n2. Sensors\n\nSensors are the tools that an AI agent uses to perceive its environment. These can be cameras, microphones, or any other sensory input that the AI agent can use to understand what is happening around it.\n\n3. Actuators\n\nActuators are the tools that an AI agent uses to interact with its environment. These can be things like robotic arms, computer screens, or any other device the AI agent can use to change the environment.\n\n4. Decision-making mechanism\n\nA decision-making mechanism is the brain of an AI agent. It processes the information gathered by the sensors and decides what action to take using the actuators. The decision-making mechanism is where the real magic happens.\n\nAI agents use various decision-making mechanisms, such as rule-based systems, expert systems, and neural networks, to make informed choices and perform tasks effectively.\n\n5. Learning system\n\nThe learning system enables the AI agent to learn from its experiences and interactions with the environment. It uses techniques like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning to improve the performance of the AI agent over time.\n\nBy understanding the environment, sensors, actuators, and decision-making mechanisms, developers can create AI agents to perform specific tasks accurately and efficiently. As AI technology evolves, we can expect new types of AI agents with even more sophisticated structures and capabilities.\n\nWith the AI agent definition and intelligent agent purpose known to you, it’s time to dive deeper into the agent function and analyze how an AI agent works in our upcoming section.\n\nHow does an AI agent work?\n\nAn AI agent works by perceiving its environment, processing information, and taking action to achieve specific goals or tasks. The process usually involves the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Perceiving the environment\n\nAn autonomous AI agent first needs to gather information about its environment. It can do so using sensors or collecting data from various sources.\n\nStep 2: Processing input data\n\nThe agent takes the knowledge gathered in Step 1 and prepares it for processing. This may include organizing the data, creating a knowledge base, or making internal representations that the agent can understand and work with.\n\nStep 3: Decision-making\n\nThe agent uses reasoning techniques like logic or statistical analysis to make an informed decision based on its knowledge base and goals. This can involve applying pre-determined rules or machine learning algorithms.\n\nStep 4: Planning and executing an action\n\nThe agent makes a plan or a series of steps to reach its goals. This may involve creating a step-by-step strategy, optimizing resource allocation, or considering various limitations and priorities. Based on its plan, the agent executes all the steps to achieve the desired goal. It can also receive feedback or new information from the environment, which can be used to adjust its future actions or update its knowledge base.\n\nStep 5: Learning and Improvement\n\nAfter taking action, the agent can learn from its own experiences. This feedback loop allows the agent to improve performance and adapt to new situations and environments.\n\nIn conclusion, autonomous AI agents collect and analyze data, preprocess it, make decisions based on machine learning algorithms, take action, and receive feedback. Now, let us simplify the working of an autonomous AI agent by taking the example of AutoGPT and BabyAGI, the modern-day and most commonly used autonomous agents.\n\nWhat is AutoGPT?\n\nAutoGPT is like a smart assistant that can handle tasks on its own. It uses the power of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, the Large Language Models (LLMs), to complete tasks without needing constant instructions. Unlike other models that rely on specific prompts, AutoGPT comes up with its own prompts to achieve its goals. Interestingly, its abilities go beyond the fed database; it can also search the web or other external sources to gather and filter out authentic information.\n\nHow does AutoGPT work?\n\nBecause AutoGPT is a recursive AI model, it overcomes traditional AI limitations by using its own results to tackle complex tasks. Here is how the model processes input and delivers relevant output:\n\n1. Giving it a name and a role: When you start AutoGPT, give it a name and tell it what it needs to do. This helps the system understand the task and make decisions accordingly.\n\n2. Training on the provided data: AutoGPT begins by learning from the information you provide. It studies the data to understand its patterns and details, helping it grasp the task better.\n\n3. Generating prompts: With its knowledge base in place, AutoGPT develops its own prompts based on what it needs to achieve. These prompts serve as the basis for its decision-making, guiding it through the tasks.\n\n4. Collecting data independently: AutoGPT doesn’t rely only on the initial data. It autonomously searches the internet and other sources, gathering more information to improve its understanding and accuracy.\n\n5. Evaluating and filtering data: The system carefully examines the collected data, checking its authenticity and relevance. It removes any incorrect or low-quality information, making sure its knowledge base is reliable.\n\n6. Continuous improvement: AutoGPT believes in constant refinement. It learns from the results it generates and uses feedback to adapt and enhance its future responses. This ongoing process helps the system refine its strategies and improve over time.\n\n7. Generating the output: Finally, AutoGPT produces its output based on its reasoning process. It combines what it has learned, the filtered data, and the context to generate a well-informed and suitable response to the given task.\n\nAutoGPT unveils itself as an independent problem-solver with impressive decision-making skills. It showcases the sheer power of AI, providing a glimpse into the potential of intelligent systems that effortlessly handle complex tasks with minimal human input. Arguably, AutoGPT paves the way for a future where machines become trusted partners in navigating our intricate world.\n\nWhat is BabyAGI?\n\nBabyAGI is a fascinating concept in the field of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It’s based on generative AI and focuses on recreating the cognitive abilities seen in young children. This research project focuses on building AI systems capable of learning and gaining knowledge from diverse sources, just like young children do!\n\nMore specifically, BabyAGI is an advanced computer program that operates with a remarkable level of autonomy. It can work independently, accomplishing tasks without users having to provide specific instructions. BabyAGI is built upon a combination of powerful programs, including Chat GPT-4, LangChain, and Pinecone.\n\nWhen an AI uses other programs or tools to accomplish tasks, it is known as Stacking. Baby AGI is one of the more robust Stacking tools created and built on Chat GPT-4. You can use this technology for various applications, including language translation, image recognition, and decision-making processes. BabyAGI is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the AI industry.\n\nHow does BabyAGI work?\n\nBaby AGI is a Python script that leverages the capabilities of OpenAI and Pinecone APIs, along with the LangChain framework, to manage and execute tasks. Its process involves generating tasks based on high-level objectives predefined by the user.\n\nUsing OpenAI’s natural language processing (NLP) abilities, the BabyAGI system creates new tasks aligned with the objectives. Moreover, it uses PineCone to store task results and the LangChain framework to make decisions.\n\nHere’s how the system operates in a loop with four steps:\n\n1. Retrieve the first task from the task list.\n2. Send the task to the execution agent, which utilizes the OpenAI API to complete the task based on the available context.\n3. Store the result in Pinecone for future reference.\n4. Generate and prioritize new tasks based on the previous task’s objective and outcome.\n\nThis continuous loop ensures that tasks are consistently executed, prioritized, and updated based on the desired objective.\n\nWhile the development of a true BabyAGI is still a long way off, there’s daily progress towards a more comprehensive performance. AI experts are actively researching and experimenting to create an AI system that can truly understand and navigate the world like a young human.\n\nWhat are the type of AI agents?\n\nHere are the five main types of AI agents:\n\nSimple reflex agents are programmed to respond to specific environmental stimuli based on pre-defined rules.\nModel-based reflex agents are reactive agents that maintain an internal model of the environment and use it to make decisions.\nGoal-based agents execute a program to achieve specific goals and take actions based on evaluating the current state of the environment.\nUtility-based agents consider the potential outcomes of their actions and choose the one that maximizes the expected utility.\nLearning agents execute machine learning techniques to improve their decision-making over time.\nWhat are the advantages of using AI agents?\n\nAI agents offer businesses the potential to streamline operations, make informed decisions, improve customer experiences, and drive growth and competitiveness in the digital age.\n\n1. Increased efficiency\n\nAI agents can automate repetitive tasks, allowing businesses to complete them faster and more accurately. This efficiency improvement frees employees’ time to focus on more business-critical tasks and improves productivity.\n\n2. Better decision-making\n\nAI agents can analyze large amounts of data and provide valuable insights to support decision-making processes. By leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning, AI agents can identify patterns, trends, and correlations that humans may overlook.\n\n3. Improved customer experience\n\nAI agents can provide personalized and timely interactions with customers, enhancing their experience. They can offer instant support, answer queries, and provide recommendations, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\n4. Cost savings\n\nBy automating tasks, AI agents can reduce the need for human resources and manual labor, resulting in cost savings for businesses. They can handle high-volume, repetitive tasks without fatigue or errors.\n\nMost common challenges you may face while using an AI agent\n\nAutonomous AI agents have become increasingly popular in recent years, with many brands implementing them for various purposes. However, several challenges come with using these agents. Some of the most common challenges are:\n\nData bias: An autonomous artificial intelligence agent program relies heavily on data to make decisions. If the data they use is biased, it can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Amazon’s AI recruiting tool was biased against women, leading to a skewed hiring process.\nLack of accountability: Proactive agents can make decisions without human intervention, so holding them accountable for their actions can be difficult. Uber’s autonomous vehicle that struck and killed a pedestrian in 2018 raised questions about who was responsible.\nLack of transparency: The decision-making processes of a learning agent can be complex and opaque, making it difficult to understand how they arrive at certain decisions.\nEthical considerations: A rational agent can make decisions with ethical implications, and it can be challenging to program them to make ethical decisions. Microsoft’s chatbot, Tay, was shut down after it started making racist and sexist comments.\nSecurity risks: Software agents can be vulnerable to cyber attacks, compromising their decision-making processes or leading to data breaches.\nLack of adaptability: Autonomous AI agents act according to their training data, which means they can struggle to adapt to new situations or contexts.\nWhat are the applications of AI agents?\n\nAutonomous AI agents have numerous applications in various industries, including:\n\nHealthcare: Autonomous artificial intelligence agents can assist in diagnosing, treating, and monitoring patients. IBM Watson Health is an AI agent that can analyze medical data to identify potential health issues and recommend treatment options.\nFinance: They can analyze financial data, detect fraud, and make investment recommendations. Charles Schwab uses an AI agent called Intelligent Portfolio to create and manage portfolios based on customers’ investment goals.\nRetail: Agents can provide personalized recommendations, improve supply chain management, and enhance customer experience. Amazon’s Alexa is an AI agent that can recommend products, place orders, and track shipments.\nManufacturing: Intelligent agents can optimize production processes, predict maintenance needs, and improve product quality. General Electric uses an AI agent called Predix to monitor machines in real-time to predict and prevent equipment failures.\nTransportation: Autonomous AI agents can assist in route planning, traffic management, and vehicle safety. Tesla’s Autopilot helps drive a vehicle autonomously and helps the driver park, lane change, and safe driving.\nEducation: They can provide personalized learning experiences, automate administrative tasks, and analyze student performance. Pearson’s AI agent, Aida, can provide feedback to students and suggest personalized learning paths.\nAgriculture: AI agents can optimize crop production, monitor soil quality, and predict weather patterns. John Deere uses an AI agent called See & Spray to detect and target weeds without affecting crops.\nWhat does the future hold for AI agents?\n\nThe future of autonomous AI agents is full of exciting possibilities. As organizations realize the potential for enhanced efficiency and productivity, the use of autonomous agents is expected to soar.\n\nA significant trend on the horizon is the customization of AI agents to meet the specific needs of businesses. As these agents become more common, it will be crucial to tailor their algorithms, data inputs, and outputs to align with each organization’s unique goals and processes.\n\nThe decision-making capabilities of AI agents are also set to undergo significant enhancements. With their increasing sophistication, these agents can effortlessly analyze vast amounts of data, providing predictions and recommendations that would otherwise require considerable human effort.\n\nHowever, as the influence of autonomous agent programs expands, ethical considerations come to the forefront. Questions surrounding privacy, bias, and accountability emerge as the deployment of these agents becomes more widespread. Balancing the tremendous potential of these AI systems with the ethical implications they pose will be a critical aspect of their future development.\n\nWant to integrate AI agents into your existing ecosystem?\n\nFrom virtual assistants to chatbots and self-driving cars, agents in artificial intelligence are changing how we live and work.

It can be either reactive, meaning it responds to stimuli without memory or planning, or proactive, meaning it has some internal state and can plan ahead. An AI agent can also be either autonomous, meaning it operates independently of human control, or cooperative, meaning it collaborates with other agents or humans. Depending on the complexity and intelligence of the agent, it can be classified into different types, such as reflex agents, goal-based agents, utility-based agents, or learning agents.\n\nAdd your perspective\nAbid Mohammed\n\nArchitecting and engineering applications, data platforms and products\n\nI have implemented the following types of AI agents\n - An agent that answers user questions based on an internal enterprise knowledge base using Retrieval Augmentation with LLM.\n- An agent when given a task, searches on the internet to find the relevant content, and then synthesizes and summarizes it into a report for the user.

Researchers are getting access to rich datasets, from historic rain trends to clinical imaging. The next-generation computing architectures, with access to rich datasets, are encouraging information scientists and researchers to innovate faster.\n\nFurthermore, progress in profound learning and ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) has also fueled the adoption of AI in several industries, such as aerospace, healthcare, manufacturing, and automotive. ANN works in recognizing similar patterns and helps in providing modified solutions. Tech companies like Google Maps have been adopting ANN to improve their route and work on the feedback received using the ANN. ANN is substituting conventional machine learning systems to evolve precise and accurate versions. For instance, recent advancements in computer vision technology, such as GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector), have led to digital image processing techniques. For instance, images and videos taken in low light, or low resolution, can be transformed into HD quality by employing these techniques. The continuous research in computer vision has built the foundation for digital image processing in security & surveillance, healthcare, and transportation, among other sectors. Such emerging methods in machine learning are anticipated to alter the manner AI versions are trained and deployed.\n\nThe WHO (World Health Organization) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic in 2020, causing a massive impact on businesses and humankind. This pandemic has emerged as an opportunity for AI-enabled computer systems to fight against the\xa0outbreak, as several tech giants and start-ups started working on preventing, mitigating, and containing the virus. For instance, the Chinese tech giant Alibaba\'s research institute Damo Academy has developed a diagnostic algorithm to detect new coronavirus cases with the chest CT (Computed Tomography) scan. The AI model used in the system has been trained with sample data from over 5,000 positive coronavirus cases. In June 2020, Lunit developed an AI solution for the X-ray analysis of the chest for simpler management of COVID-19 cases and offered assistance in interpreting, monitoring, and patient trials.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak is expected to stimulate the market growth of next-generation tech domains, including artificial intelligence, owing to the mandated WFH (work-from-home) policy due to the pandemic. For instance, LogMeIn, Inc., a U.S.-based company that provides SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) and cloud-based customer engagement and remote connectivity & collaboration services, has experienced a significant increase in new sign-ups across its product portfolios amid the pandemic. Also, tech companies are expanding their product offerings and services to widen availability across the globe. For instance, in April 2020, Google LLC launched an AI-enabled chatbot called Rapid Response Virtual Agent for call centers. This chatbot is built to respond to issues customers might be experiencing due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak over voice, chat, and other social channels.\xa0\n\nSolution Insights\n\nSoftware solutions led the market and accounted for more than 36.7% of the global revenue in 2022.

Image: Amazon\n\nDuring the AWS Summit in New York on Wednesday, Amazon launched Agents for Bedrock, which will let companies build AI apps that can automatically do tasks on their own, like booking a flight for users instead of just telling them about it. AI agents are the assistant that actually gets a restaurant reservation instead of just giving suggestions on where to eat.\n\n“I believe this will supercharge developers who wanted an easier way to build agents and at the same time customize the data the models read,” Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of data and machine learning at AWS, tells The Verge. “Building agents took so much time even with how advanced generative AI is now, but we’re making it so developers can access exactly the models they need.”\n\nAI agents are the dream for AI developers, where the power of code meets its ultimate goal, to do things humans don’t want to do\n\nGenerative AI models like GPT-4 or Llama 2 are powerful but do not actually automate some tasks for users without extra help, like plug-ins. With agents, a travel company could use generative AI to suggest trips, then build one agent that will take in a user’s travel history and interests, another agent that finds flight schedules, and finally, an agent that books the chosen flight.\n\nAmazon, along with other AI companies like Meta, Google, and OpenAI, signed an agreement with the White House last week pledging to develop responsible AI.\xa0\n\nAmazon itself hasn’t been a big player in the generative AI arms race in the way Meta, Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft have been. Still, it has positioned itself, via AWS, as a key infrastructure provider to the space.\xa0StabilityAI and Anthropic released new versions of their large language models, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 and the chatbot Claude 2, that are now available on Bedrock.\xa0\n\nAgents for Bedrock is aimed at startups and enterprises, letting companies use their own data to teach foundational models, like image-to-text models or large language models, and then build additional apps to finish tasks. A developer can choose which foundational model to use, provide some instructions, and choose which data for the model to read.\n\nOther tech companies are also working on agents; Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors there’s an opportunity to bring AI agents “to billions of people in ways that will be useful and meaningful.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, in a wide-ranging interview with The Atlantic, ruminated on AI agents and how to approach their creation best.\xa0\n\nBedrock, a platform where organizations can access foundational generative AI models like Stable Diffusion, Claude, Jurassic, and Amazon’s own Titan language, was launched in April this year.\xa0\n\nOther AWS announcements included bringing generative AI to healthcare through a new service called AWS HealthScribe and a partnership with Nvidia allowing AWS to handle larger amounts of memory and data by using Nvidia H100 Tensor Core GPUs.\n\nAWS HealthScribe automates clinical documentation, basically notes summarizing a patient’s complaint, and makes medical notes for diagnosis.\xa0AWS partnered with 3M Health Information System to deploy the tool.\xa0Sivasubramanian said using generative AI to create clinical documentation saves time for healthcare professionals and lets them interact with more patients.\xa0\n\nBringing AI to healthcare, though, will be fraught. Healthcare is one of the most regulated spaces in the US. AI companies face questions about privacy protection and security. Data privacy is one of the main focuses of the Federal Trade Commission’s investigation into OpenAI. AWS reiterated that HealthScribe is HIPAA-eligible and will not use results from HealthScribe to train the tool.\xa0\n\n“Healthcare is one of the spaces where AI can dramatically reduce the burden on people,” Sivasubramanian said.\n\nAWS made its machine learning-powered analytics tool, Entity Resolution, that helps people analyze and match documents across applications generally available.\xa0AWS also made its code assistant CodeWhisperer available in Glue Studio — a platform that simplifies coding for data analysts — to allow access for data engineers and analysts. It gives code suggestions in real time.\xa0\n\n0 COMMENTS0 NEW\n\nFEATURED VIDEOS FROM THE VERGE\n\nTesla Master Plan 3 in 4 minutes\n\nAt Tesla’s Investor day, Elon Musk’s company pulled the curtain back on its latest Master Plan 3.0, as well as details about its plans to grow to “extreme size.”\n\nMost Popular\nSam Bankman-Fried’s defense finally woke up\nWith a Switch 2 looming, Nintendo is sending out the original with a bang\nSuper Mario Bros.

summary: An AI agent is a software program designed to interact with its environment, perceive the data it receives, and take actions based on that data to achieve specific goals. AI agents can be as simple as rule-based systems or as complex as advanced machine learning models. They can operate independently without human control and can think, act, and learn on their own.

The structure of an AI agent consists of four components: the environment, sensors, actuators, and the decision-making mechanism. The environment refers to the area or domain in which the AI agent operates. Sensors are used to perceive the environment, while actuators are used to interact with the environment. The decision-making mechanism processes the information gathered by the sensors and decides what action to take.

There are different types of AI agents, including simple reflex agents, model-based reflex agents, goal-based agents, utility-based agents, and learning agents. Each type has its own characteristics and capabilities.

The advantages of using AI agents include increased efficiency, better decision-making, improved customer experience, and cost savings. However, there are also challenges associated with using AI agents, such as data bias, lack of accountability, lack of transparency, ethical considerations, security risks, and lack of adaptability.

AI agents have applications in various industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, manufacturing, transportation, education, and agriculture. They can assist in tasks such as diagnosing patients, analyzing financial data, providing personalized recommendations, optimizing production processes, and predicting weather patterns.

The future of AI agents is expected to involve customization to meet specific business needs, enhancements in decision-making capabilities, and addressing ethical considerations. As organizations realize the potential of AI agents, their use is expected to increase significantly.

Simform is an AI/ML solutions company that helps businesses integrate AI agents into their ecosystems. They offer AI/ML development services and can help businesses develop cutting-edge agent solutions to streamline processes and gain a competitive edge.
