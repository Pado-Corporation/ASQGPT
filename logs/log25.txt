Editor’s Note: We reviewed this article on September 24, 2023. As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.

Period, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren't blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month. 

Lucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I'll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.

Keep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.

COSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH

BEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types

KEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid

PRICE: $19

ABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.

About My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts

My skin can be unpredictable. But, as I've gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.  

Ingredients: One key, familiar ingredient 

The tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.

The Feel: Like a bandage

You can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Packaging: Easy to store

The 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish

I placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.

Even with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn't budge overnight.

If you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn't expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn't gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don't believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Value: Worth it

Was this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

Similar Products: You've got options

Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Variety Pack ($7): These 36 count medical-grade, chemical-free, allergy-tested patches stay put no matter how much you toss and turn throughout the night. 

Final Verdict

If you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won't regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.

HOMEGUIDEYOUR PERFECT PIMPLE PATCH
Your Perfect Pimple Patch
by ALI OSHINSKY

Ever since I stuck a cut-up Band-Aid on my face in the hopes of healing a particularly uncomfortable whitehead, I’ve been convinced that all hydrocolloid patches [i.e. pimple patches] are pretty much the same. When I emailed cosmetic chemist Victoria Fu on the subject, she confirmed my suspicion. “Hydrocolloid dressings have been around for a while,” Victoria explains, “and they’re all generally made in the same way.” Basically, there’s a special congealing liquid that’s combined with adhesive, and the mixture is applied to a plastic sheet. Sometimes, Victoria notes, acne-fighting ingredients are added to the adhesive-hydrocolloid mixture, but this doesn’t exactly do much. “You’re better off applying your regular acne treatments before applying the dressing,” says Victoria.

Thickness is another thing that doesn’t really matter—thick or thin patches shrink pimples at the same rate. In fact, the only variable you need to keep in mind is how well the patch sticks to your skin . “With good adherence,” Victoria explains, “a hydrocolloid can create an enclosed, moist, protected environment for hours and even days.”

You won't find any patches with attachment issues below. And then I further refined the list, based on price, size, and translucence. Some are more matte than others for invisible daily wear, some are big, some are tiny, some have funky shapes and colors. But enough of that, your perfect pack awaits.

The Cheapest: Peach Slices + Alba Botanica

Unlike sometimes pricey spot treatments, pimple patches don’t need to be expensive to work. Both Peach Slices and Alba Botanica’s versions net out to under $.20 per patch (15 and 18 respectively). And while Peach Slices is definitely the cheapest, Alba’s is more matte—perfect for daytime use. Plus, both are easy to buy IRL in a pinch—Peach Slices is sold at CVS, while Alba is at Target.

The Most Invisible: Rael

It doesn’t matter what a patch looks like when you’re wearing it to bed. When you want to wear it to work, it’s a different story—shiny patches stand out from skin or makeup, but matte ones go more or less undetected. These Rael patches have a slightly thinner outer edge to blend into skin, and the plastic laminate has a powdery, matte finish that’s not too conspicuous. It’s the best choice options for keeping your zit protected and treated during work hours.

The Cleanest Application: Avarelle

A big part of making sure your patch adheres well is how you apply it. Some patches, when you try to seperate them from their plastic backing, ball up on the side and create a bump that doesn’t lay flat. These Avarelle patches are packaged on a clear, perforated plastic sheet that you can fold and peel off while keeping the patch itself intact. It comes in classic, AM and PM versions (the AM versions are smaller and less obvious, and they’re infused with different anti-acne ingredients), but since the additives don’t make much of a difference, you can pick at random—I like the classic version for no reason in particular. All three variations come with the same great backing.

The One For Cysts: ZitSticka Killa Patches

Not a hydrocolloid, ZitSticka’s patches consist of a plastic cover, an adhesive ring, and a pad of salicylic acid and niacinamide microdarts meant to penetrate the epidermis and reach deep into those painful, under-the-skin pimples. Other pimple patch brands make cystic acne-fighting patches with microdarts, but ZitSticka’s are the sturdiest and feel the most comfortable on skin. The darts are the biggest, but the patch itself is slim and adheres well. They’re also the least conspicuous of the microdart patches, if you’re into wearing them out. ZitSticka’s patches are also the most expensive on this list, and come in pretty silly packaging—half of the pack is individually wrapped Killa patches, and the other half is filled with cleaning pads, which I’d recommend you skip. (Rubbing alcohol on cystic pimples only dries out the top layer of skin and traps the infection down there for longer.) Still, if you’ve tried everything you can for cysts and still can’t get relief, these are worth a try—not only do they reduce the size of the cyst, but they also prevent you from picking and making it worse.

The Best XL: Hero Mighty Patch Surface

Out of all the large acne patches I tried, the Mighty Patch Surfaces were by far the best—large enough to cover a couple close-together back zits, and sturdy enough to stay put through a shower and outfit changes. They also do a great job of being invisible, despite the large size. But that being said, if you don’t care about it blending in, Band-Aid Hydro Seal Blister Heels are of comparable size and sturdiness, and one pack costs a third as much at the drugstore.

The Cute One: Starface

The one to wear when you don’t want your coworkers staring at your face thinking, ‘Is that a pimple patch?’ They're star-shaped and yellow and quite conspicuous, but that’s the point! They're very cute. Recently, I’ve been relying on these the most for daytime—and now when a zit pops up on my cheek, I actually get excited about it. Is that weird? A bonus perk is that it’s nearly impossible to lose the little yellow pod they come in, a problem I’ve noticed with the slim sheets of other packages. Peel it off gently to avoid wrinkling any of the star points.

Reviewed: I Tried the Killa Cystic Acne Patches and OMG

I could genuinely cry right now?

BY ELIZABETH DENTONPUBLISHED: FEB 22, 2019
SAVE ARTICLE

When I was a teenager, I was one of the lucky few who made it through high school without any acne, so I kind of thought I’d be safe forever. But now that I’m in my early 30s (33 is still considered early, right?), my jaw has become a minefield of hormonal, cystic pimples that flare up at the first sign of PMS. Yay.


This content is imported from poll. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.

You wouldn’t know it by looking at me, though, because my zits so rarely come to a head—they just live deep inside, haunting me, so painful and hot that I sit there dreaming about cutting them out (dark, but true). Which is why I was stoked to hear about ZitSticka, a new acne patch specifically designed to treat below-the-surface pimples before they take over your face. And, to see if they were really worth the hype, I tested them out in the name of science clear skin.

THE PATCH DEETS

More From Cosmopolitan
 

“But I’m already obsessed with acne patches!” you cry. And, hey, same. But these are different than the hydrocolloid bandages you’ve been using from, say, Peach & Lily or CosRx. Because unlike traditional patches, which only work on zits that have already “popped” (so they can absorb fluid from the pimple), ZitSticka’s patches treat unpopped, underground zits using itty-bitty, medication-filled micro-darts. Stay with me, here.

Guess How Often You Should Wash Your Hair?

The patch—aptly named Killa—looks like a regular hydrocolloid bandage, but with one key difference: Its sticky surface is covered with 24 dissolvable micro-darts that gently penetrate the stratum corneum and epidermis (your top two layers of skin) to push medication into your pimple. Each dart is filled with acne-fighting and skin-healing ingredients, including hyaluronic acid (to moisturize), niacinamide (to calm inflammation), salicylic acid (to loosen and break down the pimple), and oligopeptide-76 (to kill bacteria).

Each Killa Kit contains eight individually packaged patches and eight pre-treat wipes (soaked with salicylic acid, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and alcohol to sanitize skin and add an extra acne-killing punch before you slap on the patch). Just dab the pimple with a wipe, let it dry for a few seconds, then stick on the patch and live your life.

See the tiny micro-darts on the sticky side of the patch?

WTF IT FELT LIKE

If you’ve used hydrocolloid patches before, you know there’s nothing more satisfying than seeing it turn white from a pimple’s gunk. It’s one of the gross-but-amazing parts of skincare. Sadly, you’re not going to get that with Killa; the darts aren’t actually permeating the zit’s core (it’s impossible to pop cystic pimples from the surface), so they won’t really draw out any gunk overnight.

Still, I was surprised by how incredibly satisfying the patch felt when I applied it—like I was doing something productive for my pimple. After washing my face and wiping down my most painful cystic zit, I pressed on the Killa patch, holding it for 15 seconds, as recommended, to help it really adhere. The darts actually do feel prickly when you first press on the patch—kind of like a piece of velcro against your skin—but the whole thing is more uncomfortable than it is painful. The brand recommends leaving the patch on for at least two hours to allow the darts to fully dissolve, but I decided to apply it right before bed to give it a full seven hours to work.

THE RESULTS

Part of me didn’t expect this patch to work at all (I’ve seen too many gimmicks), but by the time I woke up and peeled it off, my zit was noticeably calmer. The warmth and redness that had been radiating from it the night before were diminished—it was now just a pink, barely painful bump. In fact, within 48 hours, the zit had cleared up completely, as if I had gotten a cortisone injection from my derm.

I was legitimately shocked these patches worked so well, so I went to experts to find out, well, why. Was I just a lucky case? According to dermatologist Mona Gohara, MD, associate clinical professor at Yale University (and not affiliated with ZitSticka), the niacinamide (vitamin B3) in each micro-dart was the “magic ingredient” for my cyst. “Niacinamide is a potent anti-inflammatory that’s sometimes prescribed as an oral medication because it’s so effective,” she says, noting that it becomes even more powerful when combined with hyaluronic acid, which “pushes in moisture to reduce irritation.” Basically, she’s not surprised Killa worked so well for me.

WILL IT WORK FOR YOU?

Here’s the thing about Killa: It’s not an acne cure. Though the micro-darts are effective at penetrating the first two layers of skin, Dr. Gohara says the ingredients seem less effective at treating and healing pimples, and more effective at reducing the inflammation within a pimple—which, in turn, can help your body heal it faster on its own.

So what does all this mean for you? Killa patches won’t replace your skincare routine—you’ll still need a good cleanser and zit-fighting regimen—nor should they, considering a box of eight patches and wipes retails for $29, which, if you’re using them daily, will add up fast. Still, when you’ve got the occasional underground zit and don’t have the time (or money) to run to the derm for an injection, you can use these patches to help reduce the redness and swelling of a pimple fast. And that, as far as I’m concerned, is worth all of the micro-darts and money in the world.

Pattern Name: Acne PatchesVerified Purchase
I have bought many many different pimple patches in the last few years, and I find that these are one of the best values for your money. They work as well as any other brand, but the adhesion is a little less adhesive than others. Not so much that it’s an issue, but they could afford to be a little bit stickier. I recommend these over the expensive ones that barely give you any patches, don't fall for those, get these instead. They help tremendously with my breakouts, which I get often.

My teen love it for acne spots, I love them for cysts that are about to come. This patch is almost a miracle skin saver. You wear it overnight and the blemish is gone or the cyst does not develop. We tried many patches but we decided to stick with those since they are so efficient.

 THE BEST ACNE PATCH THERE IS!
Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2019
Pattern Name: Acne PatchesVerified Purchase
I found these acne patches after trying quite a few different brands. There were many issues with the others I've tried: patches didn't stay on well, they didn't absorb the funky stuff from the acne, they left a mark, and / or were way too obvious. These SAKURA ACNE PATCHES are the opposite of all that- THEY ARE AMAZING! They stay in place until they are filled up with the junk they've absorbed. They stick so well that I can wash my face with it on so I don't spread acne germs to other parts of my face. The acne is noticeably improved after wearing the patch for even just a couple (2) hours; the blemish is lighter in color, not as swollen, and not as raised! Once the patch fills up, I remove it and apply another. I repeat the process until the blemish is gone. For me, it takes about 2-3 days from start to finish. I am so thankful to have found these patches. They help clear things up quickly and painlessly, which in turn helps me feel more confident about my skin. I've purchased these patches 3 times now and will continue to do so when I am in need. I highly recommend them! PS- SAKURA, please make some sort of face mask with the qualities and powers of these patches! I can only imagine the wonders it would do for the entire face!

I order these across Amazon from quite a few brands, and these hold up just fine. These absorb oil from my skin and help reduce pimples in a healthy manner as advertised. I prefer these compared to the versions with tea tree oil. I find that the ones without the oil help skin heal faster if there have been any breaks. I will continue to purchase this brand as necessary.

 Excellent!
Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2022
Pattern Name: Acne PatchesVerified Purchase
These are great! Mid-30s mom here who has suffered with chest and back acne once a month since my teens, and these knock it out overnight (most of the time)! I like that they’re fairly inconspicuous, especially on my chest/back so I’m not as self conscious.
After a shower, I just clean the area with a cotton swab and alcohol, dry, then apply and leave on until it easily comes off (usually about 24 hours later/after another shower). 9 times out of 10, that’s all it takes and the spot is gone. Ocassionally, I have to reapply again but it’s never taken more than 2 applications.
Highly recommend, these are now a staple in my house.

Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2021
Pattern Name: Acne PatchesVerified Purchase
I was always so skeptical about trends like these. I’ve suffered with acne for decades and damn — these things work. I’m horrible at skin care and I’ll touch pop squeeze everything I’m not supposed to. I should know by now that those methods will just prolong everything but I just can’t help It and want it gone now! Let me tell you these things work. As soon as I feel some type of bump, I’ll put one on and the magic works and it’ll pull everything out and I swear by day two it looks so much better compared to day two without it. The best part is as often as I use these things and for the amount of bumps I get, I still have so many patches left. You definitely get your money’s worth AND then some. I definitely recommend and I’m definitely purchasing more — especially if they’re on the [lightning]deal of the day.

Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023
Sometimes the patch is thicker than my *** but sometimes it’s as thin as my ***. The thick one that I got for the past 2 orders wouldn’t stick to my skin and by the time I woke up in the morning, the patch will be on my hair, my bed sheet, my back and nowhere to be found. It’s good for sure but it’s like playing a Russian roulette where the thick patch is the bullet.

Such a great value for so much less. I was obsessed with obsessed with the mighty patches put they get really expensive for not a lot especially when you have a lot of pimples. Personally I get really deep painful pimples that last forever these take them away just leashing the little red mark like the patches do. So impressed with this product and the value. Love it so much and could not recommend this more.

They work!
Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2023
These little suckers do really work and I always like to have them on hand. Only thing about these was the strips the patches are on break apart and it’s hard when you’re almost done with a slip of them cause it just breaks apart. So that’s annoying and I have wasted a couple by it breaking apart since the stickiness becomes open then, but otherwise work!

They work if they manage to stay on
Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2023
These are thick, which seems to mean they pull more out, but it's little use when they don't stay stuck. I'll go back to my other brand that has the tapered edges which allows them to blend well and that stay on. I took a gamble on these and lost.
*Edit: Seller contacted me and gave me a choice of them sending me a pack of their other patches or a refund on the product, so the company is at least concerned with the quality of the product, which is a rarity these days.

Best patches ever! The grit is impressive yet gentle enough around eye area. Stay on for hours, easy to forget it’s on. Help a stubbor style within 1 use completely gone after 3 uses

Shortens the days of redness and inflammation, use them overnight, but could easily use during the day, as they are almost clear after application.

I’d like to buy these again because they are better than many but I’m torn, and I’m not sure it’s worth the risk, as two strips of dots on every sheet were gooey and useless.

I like these patches for the price. They don't adhere as well as other brands, but are much less expensive. Would buy again if they were on sale.

So good!!

I love these patches. They are wonderful. I love the added benefit of cica to them. They stick great and work amazing. I noticed that my pimples healed faster than other patches I've used before. I will definitely be recommending to my friends!

Great for Healing Acne

I really love these patches! I feel like they don’t work as well on different types of skin, but when they work...they WORK. The pimples have to basically be at a head for them to work, or if you just popped one, you can put one of the patches on it overnight to get the remaining stuff out. They work amazingly on my husband’s pimples. They work pretty good on mine too, but not as well as his. I don’t think it’s the product’s fault though. I absolutely love them and always have to have them handy around the house.

WORKS!!!

These pimple stickers work. I don't have a ton of pimples but they come up occasionally and can be painful and stubborn. It usually takes at least a week to go away but with this, it went away after 3 days-ish. I'm guessing it's because there is cica (the healing plant) in it which I haven't seen in any other pimple stickers. It's well known in K-beauty to heal scars so that's probably why? There is enough in one package to last a while (especially if you get them occasionally like me) but I'll be buying more when i run out!! If other pimple stickers didn't work for you, you should try this one out.

When I emailed cosmetic chemist Victoria Fu on the subject, she confirmed my suspicion. “Hydrocolloid dressings have been around for a while,” Victoria explains, “and they’re all generally made in the same way.” Basically, there’s a special congealing liquid that’s combined with adhesive, and the mixture is applied to a plastic sheet. Sometimes, Victoria notes, acne-fighting ingredients are added to the adhesive-hydrocolloid mixture, but this doesn’t exactly do much. “You’re better off applying your regular acne treatments before applying the dressing,” says Victoria.\n\nThickness is another thing that doesn’t really matter—thick or thin patches shrink pimples at the same rate. In fact, the only variable you need to keep in mind is how well the patch sticks to your skin . “With good adherence,” Victoria explains, “a hydrocolloid can create an enclosed, moist, protected environment for hours and even days.”\n\nYou won\'t find any patches with attachment issues below. And then I further refined the list, based on price, size, and translucence. Some are more matte than others for invisible daily wear, some are big, some are tiny, some have funky shapes and colors. But enough of that, your perfect pack awaits.\n\nThe Cheapest: Peach Slices + Alba Botanica\n\nUnlike sometimes pricey spot treatments, pimple patches don’t need to be expensive to work. Both Peach Slices and Alba Botanica’s versions net out to under $.20 per patch (15 and 18 respectively). And while Peach Slices is definitely the cheapest, Alba’s is more matte—perfect for daytime use. Plus, both are easy to buy IRL in a pinch—Peach Slices is sold at CVS, while Alba is at Target.\n\nThe Most Invisible: Rael\n\nIt doesn’t matter what a patch looks like when you’re wearing it to bed. When you want to wear it to work, it’s a different story—shiny patches stand out from skin or makeup, but matte ones go more or less undetected. These Rael patches have a slightly thinner outer edge to blend into skin, and the plastic laminate has a powdery, matte finish that’s not too conspicuous. It’s the best choice options for keeping your zit protected and treated during work hours.\n\nThe Cleanest Application: Avarelle\n\nA big part of making sure your patch adheres well is how you apply it. Some patches, when you try to seperate them from their plastic backing, ball up on the side and create a bump that doesn’t lay flat. These Avarelle patches are packaged on a clear, perforated plastic sheet that you can fold and peel off while keeping the patch itself intact. It comes in classic, AM and PM versions (the AM versions are smaller and less obvious, and they’re infused with different anti-acne ingredients), but since the additives don’t make much of a difference, you can pick at random—I like the classic version for no reason in particular. All three variations come with the same great backing.\n\nThe One For Cysts: ZitSticka Killa Patches\n\nNot a hydrocolloid, ZitSticka’s patches consist of a plastic cover, an adhesive ring, and a pad of salicylic acid and niacinamide microdarts meant to penetrate the epidermis and reach deep into those painful, under-the-skin pimples. Other pimple patch brands make cystic acne-fighting patches with microdarts, but ZitSticka’s are the sturdiest and feel the most comfortable on skin. The darts are the biggest, but the patch itself is slim and adheres well. They’re also the least conspicuous of the microdart patches, if you’re into wearing them out. ZitSticka’s patches are also the most expensive on this list, and come in pretty silly packaging—half of the pack is individually wrapped Killa patches, and the other half is filled with cleaning pads, which I’d recommend you skip. (Rubbing alcohol on cystic pimples only dries out the top layer of skin and traps the infection down there for longer.) Still, if you’ve tried everything you can for cysts and still can’t get relief, these are worth a try—not only do they reduce the size of the cyst, but they also prevent you from picking and making it worse.\n\nThe Best XL: Hero Mighty Patch Surface\n\nOut of all the large acne patches I tried, the Mighty Patch Surfaces were by far the best—large enough to cover a couple close-together back zits, and sturdy enough to stay put through a shower and outfit changes. They also do a great job of being invisible, despite the large size. But that being said, if you don’t care about it blending in, Band-Aid Hydro Seal Blister Heels are of comparable size and sturdiness, and one pack costs a third as much at the drugstore.\n\nThe Cute One: Starface\n\nThe one to wear when you don’t want your coworkers staring at your face thinking, ‘Is that a pimple patch?’ They\'re star-shaped and yellow and quite conspicuous, but that’s the point! They\'re very cute. Recently, I’ve been relying on these the most for daytime—and now when a zit pops up on my cheek, I actually get excited about it. Is that weird? A bonus perk is that it’s nearly impossible to lose the little yellow pod they come in, a problem I’ve noticed with the slim sheets of other packages. Peel it off gently to avoid wrinkling any of the star points.\n\n—Ali Oshinsky\n\nPhoto via ITG\n\nSHARETWEETPINCOPY\nMore:\nACNE\nSKINCARE\nWEIRD SKINCARE\nEVERYTHING ACNE\nDON\'T MISSMost Popular\nTHE EXTRAS\nHow To Be A Person Who Has Their Life Together\nOPEN THREAD\nWhat\'s Everyone Reading?\nTHE REVIEW\nFor Every Top Shelf, There’s a Bottom Shelf\nGUIDE\nHow Not To Mess Up Your At-Home Hair Color\nTHE EXTRAS\nThe Makeup Bags Of Glossier HQ: Extreme Makeover Edition\nGUIDE\nFind Your Tinted Moisturizer Soulmate\nSign up for email updates (including Into The Gloss stories and event invites, plus Glossier launches and product info).

They work as well as any other brand, but the adhesion is a little less adhesive than others. Not so much that it’s an issue, but they could afford to be a little bit stickier. I recommend these over the expensive ones that barely give you any patches, don\'t fall for those, get these instead.

There were many issues with the others I\'ve tried: patches didn\'t stay on well, they didn\'t absorb the funky stuff from the acne, they left a mark, and / or were way too obvious. These SAKURA ACNE PATCHES are the opposite of all that- THEY ARE AMAZING! They stay in place until they are filled up with the junk they\'ve absorbed. They stick so well that I can wash my face with it on so I don\'t spread acne germs to other parts of my face. The acne is noticeably improved after wearing the patch for even just a couple (2) hours; the blemish is lighter in color, not as swollen, and not as raised! Once the patch fills up, I remove it and apply another. I repeat the process until the blemish is gone. For me, it takes about 2-3 days from start to finish. I am so thankful to have found these patches. They help clear things up quickly and painlessly, which in turn helps me feel more confident about my skin. I\'ve purchased these patches 3 times now and will continue to do so when I am in need. I highly recommend them! PS- SAKURA, please make some sort of face mask with the qualities and powers of these patches! I can only imagine the wonders it would do for the entire face!\n11 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tLisa\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Do the job\nReviewed in the United States on November 18, 2022\nPattern Name: Acne PatchesVerified Purchase\nI order these across Amazon from quite a few brands, and these hold up just fine. These absorb oil from my skin and help reduce pimples in a healthy manner as advertised. I prefer these compared to the versions with tea tree oil. I find that the ones without the oil help skin heal faster if there have been any breaks. I will continue to purchase this brand as necessary.\nHelpful\nReport\n\tAmazon Customer\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Excellent!\nReviewed in the United States on May 23, 2022\nPattern Name: Acne PatchesVerified Purchase\nThese are great! Mid-30s mom here who has suffered with chest and back acne once a month since my teens, and these knock it out overnight (most of the time)! I like that they’re fairly inconspicuous, especially on my chest/back so I’m not as self conscious.\nAfter a shower, I just clean the area with a cotton swab and alcohol, dry, then apply and leave on until it easily comes off (usually about 24 hours later/after another shower). 9 times out of 10, that’s all it takes and the spot is gone. Ocassionally, I have to reapply again but it’s never taken more than 2 applications.\nHighly recommend, these are now a staple in my house.\nOne person found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tlynisbored\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Definitely would buy again!\nReviewed in the United States on March 18, 2021\nPattern Name: Acne PatchesVerified Purchase\nI was always so skeptical about trends like these. I’ve suffered with acne for decades and damn — these things work. I’m horrible at skin care and I’ll touch pop squeeze everything I’m not supposed to. I should know by now that those methods will just prolong everything but I just can’t help It and want it gone now! Let me tell you these things work. As soon as I feel some type of bump, I’ll put one on and the magic works and it’ll pull everything out and I swear by day two it looks so much better compared to day two without it. The best part is as often as I use these things and for the amount of bumps I get, I still have so many patches left. You definitely get your money’s worth AND then some. I definitely recommend and I’m definitely purchasing more — especially if they’re on the [lightning]deal of the day.\n3 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nPrevious page\nNext page\nQuestions?

But now that I’m in my early 30s (33 is still considered early, right?), my jaw has become a minefield of hormonal, cystic pimples that flare up at the first sign of PMS. Yay.\n\n\nThis content is imported from poll. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nYou wouldn’t know it by looking at me, though, because my zits so rarely come to a head—they just live deep inside, haunting me, so painful and hot that I sit there dreaming about cutting them out (dark, but true). Which is why I was stoked to hear about ZitSticka, a new acne patch specifically designed to treat below-the-surface pimples before they take over your face. And, to see if they were really worth the hype, I tested them out in the name of science clear skin.\n\nZitSticka Killa Kit\n$29 AT ZITSTICKA.COM\nCredit: Courtesy Image\n\nTHE PATCH DEETS\n\nMore From Cosmopolitan\n\xa0\n\n“But I’m already obsessed with acne patches!” you cry. And, hey, same. But these are different than the hydrocolloid bandages you’ve been using from, say, Peach & Lily or CosRx. Because unlike traditional patches, which only work on zits that have already “popped” (so they can absorb fluid from the pimple), ZitSticka’s patches treat unpopped, underground zits using itty-bitty, medication-filled micro-darts. Stay with me, here.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nRelated Stories\nHow to Easily Get (or Fake) Thicker Brows\nI Tried That Viral Boob Mask From Instagram\nGuess How Often You Should Wash Your Hair?\n\nThe patch—aptly named Killa—looks like a regular hydrocolloid bandage, but with one key difference: Its sticky surface is covered with 24 dissolvable micro-darts that gently penetrate the stratum corneum and epidermis (your top two layers of skin) to push medication into your pimple. Each dart is filled with acne-fighting and skin-healing ingredients, including hyaluronic acid (to moisturize), niacinamide (to calm inflammation), salicylic acid (to loosen and break down the pimple), and oligopeptide-76 (to kill bacteria).\n\nEach Killa Kit contains eight individually packaged patches and eight pre-treat wipes (soaked with salicylic acid, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and alcohol to sanitize skin and add an extra acne-killing punch before you slap on the patch). Just dab the pimple with a wipe, let it dry for a few seconds, then stick on the patch and live your life.\n\nSee the tiny micro-darts on the sticky side of the patch?\nCourtesy Image\n\nWTF IT FELT LIKE\n\nIf you’ve used hydrocolloid patches before, you know there’s nothing more satisfying than seeing it turn white from a pimple’s gunk. It’s one of the gross-but-amazing parts of skincare. Sadly, you’re not going to get that with Killa; the darts aren’t actually permeating the zit’s core (it’s impossible to pop cystic pimples from the surface), so they won’t really draw out any gunk overnight.\n\nStill, I was surprised by how incredibly satisfying the patch felt when I applied it—like I was doing something productive for my pimple. After washing my face and wiping down my most painful cystic zit, I pressed on the Killa patch, holding it for 15 seconds, as recommended, to help it really adhere. The darts actually do feel prickly when you first press on the patch—kind of like a piece of velcro against your skin—but the whole thing is more uncomfortable than it is painful. The brand recommends leaving the patch on for at least two hours to allow the darts to fully dissolve, but I decided to apply it right before bed to give it a full seven hours to work.\n\nTHE RESULTS\n\nPart of me didn’t expect this patch to work at all (I’ve seen too many gimmicks), but by the time I woke up and peeled it off, my zit was noticeably calmer. The warmth and redness that had been radiating from it the night before were diminished—it was now just a pink, barely painful bump. In fact, within 48 hours, the zit had cleared up completely, as if I had gotten a cortisone injection from my derm.\n\nMy underground zit before the sticker (left), and immediately after (right) I removed the sticker the following morning.\nElizabeth Denton\n\nI was legitimately shocked these patches worked so well, so I went to experts to find out, well, why. Was I just a lucky case? According to dermatologist Mona Gohara, MD, associate clinical professor at Yale University (and not affiliated with ZitSticka), the niacinamide (vitamin B3) in each micro-dart was the “magic ingredient” for my cyst. “Niacinamide is a potent anti-inflammatory that’s sometimes prescribed as an oral medication because it’s so effective,” she says, noting that it becomes even more powerful when combined with hyaluronic acid, which “pushes in moisture to reduce irritation.” Basically, she’s not surprised Killa worked so well for me.\n\nCourtesy\n\nWILL IT WORK FOR YOU?\n\nHere’s the thing about Killa: It’s not an acne cure. Though the micro-darts are effective at penetrating the first two layers of skin, Dr. Gohara says the ingredients seem less effective at treating and healing pimples, and more effective at reducing the inflammation within a pimple—which, in turn, can help your body heal it faster on its own.\n\nSo what does all this mean for you? Killa patches won’t replace your skincare routine—you’ll still need a good cleanser and zit-fighting regimen—nor should they, considering a box of eight patches and wipes retails for $29, which, if you’re using them daily, will add up fast. Still, when you’ve got the occasional underground zit and don’t have the time (or money) to run to the derm for an injection, you can use these patches to help reduce the redness and swelling of a pimple fast. And that, as far as I’m concerned, is worth all of the micro-darts and money in the world.\n\nThis content is imported from poll.

We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.\n\nPeriod, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren\'t blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month.\xa0\n\nLucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I\'ll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.\n\nKeep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.\n\nCOSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH\n\nBEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types\n\nKEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid\n\nPRICE: $19\n\nABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.\n\nAbout My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts\n\nMy skin can be unpredictable. But, as I\'ve gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.\xa0\xa0\n\nIngredients: One key, familiar ingredient\xa0\n\nThe tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.\n\nThe Feel: Like a bandage\n\nYou can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Packaging: Easy to store\n\nThe 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish\n\nI placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.\n\nEven with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn\'t budge overnight.\n\nIf you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn\'t expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn\'t gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don\'t believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Value: Worth it\n\nWas this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nSimilar Products: You\'ve got options\xa0\n\nsquish.

They are wonderful. I love the added benefit of cica to them. They stick great and work amazing. I noticed that my pimples healed faster than other patches I\'ve used before. I will definitely be recommending to my friends!\n\nM\n 09/30/2021\nMaggie Zhou\nGreat for Healing Acne\n\nI really love these patches! I feel like they don’t work as well on different types of skin, but when they work...they WORK. The pimples have to basically be at a head for them to work, or if you just popped one, you can put one of the patches on it overnight to get the remaining stuff out. They work amazingly on my husband’s pimples. They work pretty good on mine too, but not as well as his. I don’t think it’s the product’s fault though. I absolutely love them and always have to have them handy around the house.\n\nM\n 09/30/2021\n MJ\nWORKS!!!\n\nThese pimple stickers work. I don\'t have a ton of pimples but they come up occasionally and can be painful and stubborn. It usually takes at least a week to go away but with this, it went away after 3 days-ish. I\'m guessing it\'s because there is cica (the healing plant) in it which I haven\'t seen in any other pimple stickers. It\'s well known in K-beauty to heal scars so that\'s probably why? There is enough in one package to last a while (especially if you get them occasionally like me) but I\'ll be buying more when i run out!! If other pimple stickers didn\'t work for you, you should try this one out.\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\nSAVE $3\n\nCICA CREAM\n\n4.8\n(62)\n$19.97 $22.97\n\nCICA GEL MOISTURIZER\n\n$24.97\nSAVE $5\n\nCICA & VITAMIN C SERUM\n\n4.5\n(61)\n$19.97 $24.97\nSAVE $5\n\nCICA REDNESS SOLUTION CREAM\n\n5.0\n(8)\n$17.97 $22.97\nSAVE $6.99\n\nSPEEDY SKINCARE DUO\n\n5.0\n(2)\n$31.95 $38.94\nSAVE $7\n\nCICA EYE CREAM\n\n4.5\n(39)\n$15.97 $22.97\n\nFOOTER MENU\n\nShop Mee\nWhat is Cica?\nAbout Meebak\nFAQ\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\ninfo@meebak.com\nMedia\n\nNEWSLETTER\n\nBecome a Meebak Insider!

I took a gamble on these and lost.\n*Edit: Seller contacted me and gave me a choice of them sending me a pack of their other patches or a refund on the product, so the company is at least concerned with the quality of the product, which is a rarity these days.\nOne person found this helpful\nSearch\nSORT BY\nTop reviews\nMost recent\nTop reviews\nFILTER BY\nAll reviewers\nVerified purchase only\nAll reviewers\nAll stars\n5 star only\n4 star only\n3 star only\n2 star only\n1 star only\nPositive reviews\nCritical reviews\nAll stars\nAll formats\nColor: Clear-176 Count\nAll formats\nText, image, video\nImage and video reviews only\nText, image, video\n2,214 total ratings, 338 with reviews\nTranslate all reviews to English\nFrom the United States\n\tAlex H.\n4.0 out of 5 stars\n They work!\nReviewed in the United States on September 14, 2023\nColor: Clear-176 CountVerified Purchase\nThese little suckers do really work and I always like to have them on hand.

ACNE BRANDS CAPITALIZING ON THE “ICK FACTOR” AS A RECIPE FOR TIKTOK SUCCESS
CRISTINA MONTEMAYOR
PUBLISHED APRIL 24, 2022
FEATURE SKINCARE MARKETING

Since the dawn of the internet, “oddly satisfying” videos have captivated people’s attention. Pimple-popping videos are among the oldest and most popular types of strangely satisfying content that people love to watch (or love to hate-watch). 

Internet historians trace the origin of the trend back to 2015 with Dr. Pimple Popper’s viral videos, but even after seven years and a network television show, people still aren’t sick of these ick-inducing videos. TikTok dermatologists are capitalizing on the trend, posting their reaction to some close-up videos of pimple popping, blackhead squeezing, and cyst squashing, racking up millions of views in their expert dissection of another’s expert dissection. 

While watching these videos through half-shut eyes is somewhat satisfying, it’s even more satisfying to experience the ick IRL. Pimple patches allow people to take their overfilled zits into their own hands and experience the visual and physical relief of popping a pimple sans scalpel. Pimple patches have soared in popularity over the last few years, with searches expected to grow 30% over the next 12 months according to Spate.

Acne brands selling pimple patches are tapping into the pimple-popping trend to showcase the effectiveness of their products, and seeing incredible engagement and conversion on these engrossing videos. BeautyMatter spoke to four acne brands to understand how they make the most of this long-standing trend and why they believe it resonates so deeply with their customers and on social. 

Peace Out Skincare has been on a mission to erase the stigma surrounding acne since the brand launched in 2017—long before acne positivity entered the beauty zeitgeist. The brand’s best-selling acne patches were the first on the market to combine active ingredients with a medical grade hydrocolloid polymer, leading to more than 35 million patches sold worldwide. Peace Out’s honest and relatable approach to acne has made the brand wildly popular on TikTok, garnering 90.1K followers and 2.6MM likes. 

The ​​#peaceoutskincare tag has over 26.1MM views, with nearly all of the most popular videos falling into the “oddly satisfying” content category, showing the overfilled pore strips and pimple patches. Junior Pence, Chief Marketing Officer and Creative Director at Peace Out, says that these videos were primarily user-generated in the beginning.

“We got early into understanding the ‘gross’ effect of Peace Out Acne Dots,” says Pence. “It started out as all organic UGC. Our consumers, people that know our brand and love our brand, put it up there themselves.”

Peace Out seeds product to nano and micro influencers, many of whom have posted about the brand before. The brand strives to build and nurture these relationships, believing them to be more fruitful than paid promotions with large influencers. 

“We've always believed that the micro influencer is the number one influencer that you could possibly ever have. It’s all about honesty and integrity,” says Pence. “What we learn from our consumers and our customers when they give us feedback is that they will only trust a nano influencer.”

“We got early into understanding the ‘gross’ effect of Peace Out Acne Dots.”
BY JUNIOR PENCE, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER + CREATIVE DIRECTOR, PEACE OUT

Pence says that the brand only receives positive feedback on the “gross” videos they share of customers using their products. In fact, the videos have been so successful that the brands use them in paid social ads, where they continuously have a click-through rate of around 7%, as opposed to average 3.4%.  

“We've never got pushback on showing the product or being honest about what happens when you use the product because that's the benefit of the product, watching the gunk being sucked into the hydrocolloid.”

One of their more recent viral videos is a 20-second close-up video showing someone removing an acne patch, revealing the juicy inside. The video has racked up over 3.2 million views and over 289,000 likes. Pence says this speaks to the consumer demand for authenticity in marketing, especially in skincare. 

“I think they're looking for [brands] to be authentic, and to know that you're actually telling the truth about what your product is and what it does. What is the benefit of using this product?” says Pence. “At the end of the day, that's the biggest feedback we get. People love our product because it does what it says it does in the least amount of time so that they can go back to feeling good about themselves.”

Peace Out isn’t the only acne brand capitalizing on the popularity of these #oddlysatisfying videos. ZitSticka, a skincare brand known for its acne patches, sees higher engagement on these videos versus others.

“There’s a kind of visceral satisfaction in seeing, say, the contents of your zit extracted or a hyper-macro video of a hair being tweezed,” says Melissa Kenny, Director of Communications at ZitSticka. “It feels almost primal, but also difficult to trace! This category of content definitely arouses a good deal of interest/interaction for ZitSticka on TikTok (as well as Instagram) which might be explained as being cathartic or stress-relieving for some.”

For COSRX, the Korean skincare brand credited for being the first to market with the iconic Acne Pimple Master Patch, sees a deeper explanation for the popularity of these videos.

“Social media is a diary of our collective unconscious,” a representative from the skincare brand tells BeautyMatter. “The oddly satisfying videos reflect our wider sentiments, preferences, and desires. People can't stop watching these satisfying videos because they are projecting themselves onto the person in the video who’s pulling off an acne pimple patch from their skin.”

Bioré Skincare is best known for its classic pore strip, which predates the acne patch craze of recent years by at least decade. The Biore tag on TikTok is filled with examples of this trend, garnering over 88 million views. The brand knows exactly why consumers keep coming back to the iconic pore strip: the satisfaction of clean and clear pores.

“There’s something about people sharing their stripping experience—and the gunk that comes with it—that consumers just can’t get enough of,” says Leah Stone, Associate Director of Face Care at Bioré Skincare. “Watching up-close and personal content of others clearing out their pores can evoke feelings of fulfillment and productivity, and can even inspire the viewer to take action when it comes to their own skin. There is also a sense of community when it comes to these videos—they bring a certain comfort to some viewers in knowing they’re not alone in their skin struggles, and all who watch them share that same intrigue and craving for a satisfying experience.”

Sonia Elyss, beauty marketing strategist and President and founder of Round Twelve, a digital marketing consultancy, explains why she believes these types of videos overperform on TikTok. 

“While I do believe there is an audience that truly enjoys and feels that odd sense of satisfaction from this up-close-and-personal look at something that is deemed ‘gross,’ many others just have to slow down to watch, even though they truly feel it IS gross,” says Elyss. “Consider the car crash effect. Most people don't actually want to see anything gruesome, but everyone slows down to watch! As we watch and rewatch TikTok's algorithm picks up on our ‘interest’ in the content distributing it to others on the platform at a faster rate.”

Most people will never experience an extraction worthy of Dr. Pimple Popper, and that’s probably a good thing. But most people will experience the occasional pimple, and when they do, there may be a small part of them that feels giddy at the excuse to see a pimple patch at its fullest potential. Even if you don’t find watching these videos on TikTok #oddlysatisfying, when it happens to you, it’s just plain satisfying.

The zit sticker war
BY LIZ FLORAAUG 21, 2020  •  6 MIN READ
Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit

Like BB cream, double cleansing and essence, the acne patch has emerged as the latest K-beauty innovation well on its way to becoming a full-blown beauty craze in the United States.

Inspiring a host of successful, recently launched startups, including ZitSticka, Starface, Hero Cosmetics and Peace Out, the acne patch market in the U.S. is heating up. Original players in the space include K-beauty brands like COSRX and Amorepacific-owned labels, while Estée Lauder-owned K-beauty brand Dr. Jart also offers patches. 

Now available with a range of different ingredients, the most common acne patches feature hydrocolloid, an ingredient used in wound dressings to promote healing. The substance uses a gelling agent to draw out pus, which makes it a useful tool for acne. The use of hydrocolloid acne patches in beauty caught on in South Korea around 10 years ago and has since become a K-beauty staple. Ju Rhyu founded Hero Cosmetics in 2017 with its flagship hydrocolloid Mighty Patch, and has since expanded to other patches including micropoint and daytime patches. The brand has seen 25% month-over-month sales growth since January. 

“I noticed people in Korea wearing acne patches,” she said of her first encounters with the product. “I didn’t know what they were, and I was really curious. I found out they were for acne, so I bought some and I tried them, and I was amazed at how well they work. I immediately started wondering why they weren’t more available or widely known in the U.S.” 

Rhyu started doing her research and found that wound care brands like Nexcare offered acne patches in the U.S., but consumers were not widely aware of their existence. “I wanted to basically move it away from the Band-Aid aisle,” said Rhyu. “I want to offer more of a beauty product, because acne is a skin care and cosmetic issue.” Learning that the acne patch market in South Korea was worth $50 million showed its promise for other markets.

“If you look all across the board,” South Koreans are “no strangers to using products that are not typically meant for beauty as tools for beauty,” said Charlotte Cho, the co-founder of beauty e-commerce platform Soko Glam, which offers four different brands of acne patches. Cho said Soko Glam was the first to introduce acne patches to the U.S. market when its e-commerce site was launched in 2012. The first acne patches she stocked in the store were from MISSHA, offering a package of 96 patches for $7. They were followed by versions from other popular brands, including COSRX.


“The whole acne pimple patch category is one of our No. 1 categories for Soko Glam,” said Cho, who noted that acne products are seeing especially high demand during the pandemic. In response, the site is selling a “Maskne Treatment Duo” that includes microneedle acne patches. The e-tailer’s brand incubator Soko Glam Labs is also planning on expanding into this category.

Some zit sticker startups in the U.S. tend to focus specifically on either millennial or Gen-Z age demographics, using differing retail channels, brand identity and price points for each age group. Adult acne has become an important market as brands become increasingly aware that acne is not just a teen problem — one third of acne doctor visits are actually made by those over the age of 25, and studies show that up to 55% of adults experience acne.

The biggest customer group for 1.5-year-old ZitSticka is in the age range of 22-38, said its co-founder and director Daniel Kaplan. The VC-backed brand utilizes millennial-pink branding, and sells through its DTC site as well as upscale retailers like Violet Grey, Goop and Net-a-Porter. It received a boost when when Chrissy Teigen shared that she uses the product on her Instagram Stories.

 

“We really wanted to de-stigmatize acne,” said Kaplan. “To do that, an important part of it was taking acne treatments and the look of acne treatments, and throwing them into the beauty world — rather than [creating] a product that looks like it belongs on a CVS shelf.” 

Acne patch brands in South Korea tend to be at a much lower price point than their counterparts in the U.S.

“It’s very affordable in Korea,” said Cho. “It’s very drugstore. I haven’t seen any elevated pimple patches, other than those that have specific technology that is proprietary. Once more brands in the U.S. come into the market, I honestly don’t think it’s going to be feasible to keep the prices as high as some of these brands are.” 

Starface, meanwhile, launched in September 2019 and has tackled the teen acne market with its “Gen Z yellow” branding and strong ties with TikTok’s most popular influencers; Charli D’Amelio and Addison Rae have helped the brand skyrocket to fame by wearing the brand’s distinctive star-shaped patches in their dance videos. The brand also generates engagement on social media through its cartoon Big Yellow character, which serves as a form of mascot for the brand and adorns the product’s packaging. 

“Our audience is predominantly 17- to 24-year-olds. We are very much a Gen Z brand, but we also have a really strong millennial customer base. I think that’s because acne is so pervasive, because 95% of people experience this,” said Starface founder Julie Schott. She said she was inspired to start the brand when seeing the products in Seoul while working as a beauty editor at Elle. 

Functionality-oriented K-beauty has not adopted the Gen Z-friendly practice of releasing patches in fun shapes and colors. But U.S. brands have joined Starface in the trend, including Squish’s bejeweled flower patches, which are sold at Urban Outfitters, and Truly’s CBD-infused marijuana leaves, stars and hearts.

“I think Korean [beauty] is just more about function,” said Cho. “It’s been around for so long, and they’re really not trying to make a brand new moment out of it. It’s like a Band-Aid.”

The fun shapes are not needed to normalize wearing the patches during the day in South Korea, said Cho. She said it’s not uncommon to see professionals wearing them in the office. 

“Skin care was very private as a culture in the U.S.,” said Cho. “But in Korea, my experience with skin care was that people are very vocal about what they use.” She said that when she introduced pimple patches to the U.S., “everyone would ask me, ‘You can only wear them at night, right?’”

Starface has been especially vocal about trying to change that by turning the patches into a mini status symbol. Part of its branding ethos is to never use words like “blemish” or “imperfections” to describe pimples. “That might seem like a small decision, but to us, that can be so damaging to those who are who are experiencing acne,” said Schott. “We’re really deliberate about language, about positioning and just trying to bring optimism and joy to something that has never been joyful or positive before.”

Peace Out Skincare, meanwhile, has seen significant growth targeting a wider range of the age spectrum, tapping into TikTok “skinfluencers” to reach Gen Z and more traditional channels like YouTube for a millennial audience. 

Many acne patch brands including Peace Out, ZitSticka, Starface and Hero offer subscriptions on their DTC sites, tapping into a model that has worked well for DTC personal care products like razors. Hero Cosmetics sees around 25-30% of its sales coming from subscriptions.

“The subscription model has just made sense,” said Schott. “It’s similar to the toothbrush/toothpaste type of model, where you’re like, ‘OK, this just arrives every month, and I don’t have to worry about it.’ There are just certain customers who want that.”

How an Acne Patch Brand Took Over the Gen Z Audience – What's Working in Marketing™

Welcome back to another week of What's Working in Marketing, a weekly newsletter where we share what's working outside your own four walls across the digital marketing landscape so you can be more effective. If you enjoy reading this, follow me on LinkedIn or create a FREE Insight Library account, our team is publishing tons of free research that you won't want to miss. 




This week we're breaking down:

Trending Research: Uncovering how Starface captured the Gen Z audience 
#MarketingTwitter: Three tweets about TikTok's new topic video feeds, the end of marketing attribution (???) and three reasons people buy 




HOW AN ACNE PATCH COMPANY CAPTURED THE GEN Z AUDIENCE

A LOOK INTO THE SKINCARE INDUSTRY

Today, I'm taking a look at Starface, an acne patch company that has continually brought an innovative social media strategy to the world, capturing the heart of all Gen Zs, one at a time.

Let's jump in!

The Audience Landscape

In 2021, Starface generated 192K average site visits per month, with 81% of traffic coming from mobile devices.

Web Traffic by Device

Outside of direct and organic search, social media drives the highest volume of traffic (21%) to mobile devices.

Share of Web Traffic by Platform

Since Starface’s target demographic is 18-24 year olds, the brand is consciously making an effort to have a presence on apps that are the most popular with the Gen Z age group.

Share of Audience on Social Media Apps by Age Group

Suggestion to Test

Fish Where the Fish Are: Starface has been intentional about where they post content. They ensure a presence on all social media apps but have strategically positioned themselves on community platforms like Discord because their audience is already there.
Devices: Take a look at your own analytics and see what device is driving traffic to your site. If you have a mobile-forward demographic, it might be time to start thinking intentionally about optimizing all aspects of your presence to mobile.
Starface's Unique & Impactful Campaigns

#1. Championing the Acne Positivity Movement

Suggestions to Test

Set the Tone: Starface encourages consumers to be open about their acne problems and to love their bare skin.




Social Encouragement: On social media, the brand consistently publishes posts that focus on self-love and boosting one’s confidence. 




Act on Values: On Starface’s TikTok channel, the brand is not afraid to post pimple-popping videos, and encourages followers to show their star-studded faces! 










﻿#2. Giveaways

Suggestions to Test

Collaborate: Starface partnered up with Europhia's makeup designer Donni Davy to host a giveaway to win free products. The Donni x Starface giveaway generated +148% more engagement compared to the non-giveaway Instagram posts.




Be Timely: What's an unexpected but niche partnership your audience would understand and support? Think about unique ways to tie creators into your marketing plans and initiatives. 













#3. Creating a Sense of Community3

Suggestions to Test

Go Where Your Audience Is: Starface created its own space to build a community using Discord. Discord had the highest share of 18-24 year old users on social media in 2021, leading to their community having over 1.2K users in 2022. 
Segmenting Conversations: On Discord, Starface has different channels for general chatting, skincare and even a safe space for mental health and self-care. 




Want an Activation Breakdown™ for your audience? 👇

Here are three tweets you should check out this week:

1. TikTok's new video topic feeds

2. The end of marketing attribution?

 3. Three reasons why people buy

If you're enjoying the newsletter so far, I want to encourage you to check out The RightMetric Insight Library.

It's full of strategy tear-downs and examples from fast-growing brands that have already helped thousands of marketers identify content opportunities, focus on the right whitespace channels, improve their media strategies, and benchmark  against competitors.




🥰 Thank You! 🥰

That's all for this week, I hope that you enjoyed it. If you found this valuable, I'd really appreciate it if you tagged someone who should read this in the comments.

I'll catch you next week. ✌🏼

Building RightMetric, a Research-as-a-Service firm used by Red Bull, lululemon, and Meta.\nPublished Feb 22, 2023\n+ Follow\n\nWelcome back to another week of What\'s Working in Marketing, a weekly newsletter where we share what\'s working outside your own four walls across the digital marketing landscape so you can be more effective. If you enjoy reading this,\xa0follow me on LinkedIn\xa0or create a\xa0FREE Insight Library account, our team is publishing tons of free research that you won\'t want to miss.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nThis week we\'re breaking down:\n\nTrending Research:\xa0Uncovering how Starface captured the Gen Z audience\xa0\n#MarketingTwitter: Three tweets about TikTok\'s new topic video feeds, the end of marketing attribution (???) and three reasons people buy\xa0\n\n\n\n\nHOW AN ACNE PATCH COMPANY CAPTURED THE GEN Z AUDIENCE\n\nA LOOK INTO THE SKINCARE INDUSTRY\n\nToday, I\'m taking a look at Starface, an acne patch company that has continually brought an innovative social media strategy to the world, capturing the heart of all Gen Zs, one at a time.\n\nLet\'s jump in!\n\nThe Audience Landscape\n\nIn 2021, Starface generated 192K average site visits per month, with 81% of traffic coming from mobile devices.\n\nWeb Traffic by Device\n\nOutside of direct and organic search, social media drives the highest volume of traffic (21%) to mobile devices.\n\nShare of Web Traffic by Platform\n\nSince Starface’s target demographic is 18-24 year olds, the brand is consciously making an effort to have a presence on apps that are the most popular with the Gen Z age group.\n\nShare of Audience on Social Media Apps by Age Group\n\nSuggestion to Test\n\nFish Where the Fish Are: Starface has been intentional about where they post content. They ensure a presence on all social media apps but have strategically positioned themselves on community platforms like Discord because their audience is already there.\nDevices: Take a look at your own analytics and see what device is driving traffic to your site. If you have a mobile-forward demographic, it might be time to start thinking intentionally about optimizing all aspects of your presence to mobile.\nStarface\'s Unique & Impactful Campaigns\n\n#1. Championing the Acne Positivity Movement\n\nSuggestions to Test\n\nSet the Tone: Starface encourages consumers to be open about their acne problems and to love their bare skin.\n\n\n\n\nSocial Encouragement: On social media, the brand consistently publishes posts that focus on self-love and boosting one’s confidence.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nAct on Values: On Starface’s TikTok channel, the brand is not afraid to post pimple-popping videos, and encourages followers to show their star-studded faces!\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ufeff#2. Giveaways\n\nSuggestions to Test\n\nCollaborate: Starface partnered up with Europhia\'s makeup designer Donni Davy to host a giveaway to win free products. The Donni x Starface giveaway generated +148% more engagement compared to the non-giveaway Instagram posts.\n\n\n\n\nBe Timely: What\'s an unexpected but niche partnership your audience would understand and support? Think about unique ways to tie creators into your marketing plans and initiatives.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#3. Creating a Sense of Community3\n\nSuggestions to Test\n\nGo Where Your Audience Is: Starface created its own space to build a community using Discord. Discord had the highest share of 18-24 year old users on social media in 2021, leading to their community having over 1.2K users in 2022.\xa0\nSegmenting Conversations: On Discord, Starface has different channels for general chatting, skincare and even a safe space for mental health and self-care.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nWant an Activation Breakdown™ for your audience? 👇\n\nHere are three tweets you should check out this week:\n\n1. TikTok\'s new video topic feeds\n\n2. The end of marketing attribution?\n\n\xa03. Three reasons why people buy\n\nIf you\'re enjoying the newsletter so far, I want to encourage you to check out\xa0The RightMetric Insight Library.\n\nIt\'s full of strategy tear-downs and examples from fast-growing brands that have already helped thousands of marketers\xa0identify\xa0content opportunities,\xa0focus\xa0on the right whitespace channels,\xa0improve\xa0their media strategies, and\xa0benchmark\xa0 against competitors.\n\n\n\n\n🥰 Thank You! 🥰\n\nThat\'s all for this week, I hope that you enjoyed it.

Original players in the space include K-beauty brands like COSRX and Amorepacific-owned labels, while Estée Lauder-owned K-beauty brand Dr. Jart also offers patches.\xa0\n\nNow available with a range of different ingredients, the most common acne patches feature hydrocolloid, an ingredient used in wound dressings to promote healing. The substance uses a gelling agent to draw out pus, which makes it a useful tool for acne. The use of hydrocolloid acne patches in beauty caught on in South Korea around 10 years ago and has since become a K-beauty staple. Ju Rhyu founded Hero Cosmetics in 2017 with its flagship hydrocolloid Mighty Patch, and has since expanded to other patches including micropoint and daytime patches. The brand has seen 25% month-over-month sales growth since January.\xa0\n\n“I noticed people in Korea wearing acne patches,” she said of her first encounters with the product. “I didn’t know what they were, and I was really curious. I found out they were for acne, so I bought some and I tried them, and I was amazed at how well they work. I immediately started wondering why they weren’t more available or widely known in the U.S.”\xa0\n\nRhyu started doing her research and found that wound care brands like Nexcare offered acne patches in the U.S., but consumers were not widely aware of their existence.\xa0“I wanted to basically move it away from the Band-Aid aisle,” said Rhyu. “I want to offer more of a beauty product, because acne is a skin care and cosmetic issue.” Learning that the acne patch market in South Korea was worth $50 million showed its promise for other markets.\n\n“If you look all across the board,” South Koreans are “no strangers to using products that are not typically meant for beauty as tools for beauty,” said Charlotte Cho, the co-founder of beauty e-commerce platform Soko Glam, which offers four different brands of acne patches. Cho said Soko Glam was the first to introduce acne patches to the U.S. market when its e-commerce site was launched in 2012. The first acne patches she stocked in the store were from MISSHA, offering a package of 96 patches for $7. They were followed by versions from other popular brands, including COSRX.\n\n\n“The whole acne pimple patch category is one of our No. 1 categories for Soko Glam,” said Cho, who noted that acne products are seeing especially high demand during the pandemic. In response, the site is selling a “Maskne Treatment Duo” that includes microneedle acne patches. The e-tailer’s brand incubator Soko Glam Labs is also planning on expanding into this category.\n\nSome zit sticker startups in the U.S. tend to focus specifically on either millennial or Gen-Z age demographics, using differing retail channels, brand identity and price points for each age group. Adult acne has become an important market\xa0as brands become increasingly aware that acne is not just a teen problem — one third of acne doctor visits are actually made by those over the age of 25, and studies show that up to 55% of adults experience acne.\n\nThe biggest customer group for 1.5-year-old ZitSticka is in the age range of 22-38, said its co-founder and director Daniel Kaplan. The VC-backed brand utilizes millennial-pink branding, and sells through its DTC site as well as upscale retailers like Violet Grey, Goop and Net-a-Porter. It received a boost when when Chrissy Teigen shared that she uses the product on her Instagram Stories.\n\n\xa0\n\n“We really wanted to de-stigmatize acne,” said Kaplan. “To do that, an important part of it was taking acne treatments and the look of acne treatments, and throwing them into the beauty world — rather than [creating] a product that looks like it belongs on a CVS shelf.”\xa0\n\nAcne patch brands in South Korea tend to be at a much lower price point than their counterparts in the U.S.\n\n“It’s very affordable in Korea,” said Cho. “It’s very drugstore. I haven’t seen any elevated pimple patches, other than those that have specific technology that is proprietary. Once more brands in the U.S. come into the market, I honestly don’t think it’s going to be feasible to keep the prices as high as some of these brands are.”\xa0\n\nStarface, meanwhile, launched in September 2019 and has tackled the teen acne market with its “Gen Z yellow” branding and strong ties with TikTok’s most popular influencers; Charli D’Amelio and Addison Rae have helped the brand skyrocket to fame by wearing the brand’s distinctive star-shaped patches in their dance videos. The brand also generates engagement on social media through its cartoon Big Yellow character, which serves as a form of mascot for the brand and adorns the product’s packaging.\xa0\n\n“Our audience is predominantly 17- to 24-year-olds. We are very much a Gen Z brand, but we also have a really strong millennial customer base. I think that’s because acne is so pervasive, because 95% of people\xa0experience this,” said Starface founder Julie Schott. She said she was inspired to start the brand when seeing the products in Seoul while working as a beauty editor at Elle.\xa0\n\nFunctionality-oriented K-beauty has not adopted the Gen Z-friendly practice of releasing patches in fun shapes and colors. But U.S.\xa0brands have joined Starface in the trend, including Squish’s bejeweled flower patches, which are sold at Urban Outfitters, and Truly’s CBD-infused marijuana leaves, stars and hearts.\n\n“I think Korean [beauty] is just more about function,” said Cho. “It’s been around for so long, and they’re really not trying to make a brand new moment out of it. It’s like a Band-Aid.”\n\nThe fun shapes are not needed to normalize wearing the patches during the day in South Korea, said Cho. She said it’s not uncommon to see professionals wearing them in the office.\xa0\n\n“Skin care was very private as a culture in the U.S.,” said Cho. “But in Korea, my experience with skin care was that people are very vocal about what they use.” She said that when she introduced pimple patches to the U.S., “everyone would ask me, ‘You can only wear them at night, right?’”\n\nStarface has been especially vocal about trying to change that by turning the patches into a mini status symbol. Part of its branding ethos is to never use words like “blemish” or “imperfections” to describe pimples. “That might seem like a small decision, but to us, that can be so damaging to those who are who are experiencing acne,” said Schott. “We’re really deliberate about language, about positioning and just trying to bring optimism and joy to something that has never been joyful or positive before.”\n\nPeace Out Skincare, meanwhile, has seen significant growth targeting a wider range of the age spectrum, tapping into TikTok “skinfluencers” to reach Gen Z and more traditional channels like YouTube for a millennial audience.\xa0\n\nMany acne patch brands including Peace Out, ZitSticka, Starface and Hero offer subscriptions on their DTC sites, tapping into a model that has worked well for DTC personal care products like razors. Hero Cosmetics sees around 25-30% of its sales coming from subscriptions.\n\n“The subscription model has just made sense,” said Schott. “It’s similar to the toothbrush/toothpaste type of model, where you’re like, ‘OK, this just arrives every month, and I don’t have to worry about it.’ There are just certain customers who want that.”\n\nFacebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit\nRelated reads\nTHE GLOSSY BEAUTY PODCAST\nViolette Serrat on building Violette FR to be a ‘modern maison’\nBEAUTY\nBeauty brands are letting customers co-create products to fuel loyalty\nMEMBER EXCLUSIVE\nBeauty & Wellness Briefing: Student loan payments put a damper on holiday (sales) cheer\nLatest Stories\nFASHION\nExclusive: Alo Yoga launches Alo Atelier luxury collection\nFASHION\nHow Florence by Mills increased its TikTok views by nearly 800%\nTHE GLOSSY BEAUTY PODCAST\nViolette Serrat on building Violette FR to be a ‘modern maison’\n\nGet news and analysis about fashion, beauty and culture delivered to your inbox every morning.\n\nReach Out\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nInstagram\nThreads\nEmail\nAbout Us\nAbout Us\nMasthead\nAdvertise with us\nDigiday Media\nCustom\nFAQ\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms & Conditions\n©2023 Digiday Media.

Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2023
This is really an excellent product it does exactly what it says --either dramatically improves or gets rid of the blemish altogether anywhere from as quickly as overnight to two to three days at most depending on the blemish you do have to apply it on clean dry skin so it sticks well I wouldn't wear it out during the day because while it is pretty sheer you can still see it because it doesn't lay flush on your skin but it does exactly what it says and it's fantastic and I can't say enough about it

A lot of people rave about these, but I don’t think they really do anything for my acne. When I take them off, they rip the bump open and that’s it really!

Works the way it supposed to, but the first pack I opened already had a little white dots on the pimple patches. It may have been stored somewhere with moisture, but they still looked new, so I will still be using them. I love that they have a variety of sizes in this pack came with a lot. I typically use a different brand, but they were not available online. Good overall.

Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2023

These are amazing. I wish I had them when I was a teen with embarrassing acne. Now I have an occasional blemish, and this takes care of it in no time. I put a patch on before bed, and it has never come off while I was sleeping. I also have somewhat sensitive skin, and this has never caused any redness. I highly recommend them.

 A product that actually does what it advertises
Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2023
Verified Purchase
I've been using these patches for over 5 years now and they have never let me down! They are a constant staple in my skincare routine. They cover up unsightly breakouts while dealing with the problem below the surface (drawing the oil/puss from the breakout and expelling it from your skin). They are easy to apply, can last for over 24 hours on skin, and appear sheer on your skin if you need to wear in public. I typically like to put them on at night after my skincare routine before I go to bed and remove in the morning and will repeat until the breakout is gone. The variety size pack is great so you can tailor to the size of your breakout. There are a lot of these products on the market but these are by far the best and affordable too!

I’ve tried out multiple types of pimple patches and these are my favorite. I use tweezers to apply them so I don’t remove any of the stickiness by using my fingertips. The different sizes are so helpful and I use these often. Worth the money.

Half half
Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023
Sometimes the patch is thicker than my *** but sometimes it’s as thin as my ***. The thick one that I got for the past 2 orders wouldn’t stick to my skin and by the time I woke up in the morning, the patch will be on my hair, my bed sheet, my back and nowhere to be found. It’s good for sure but it’s like playing a Russian roulette where the thick patch is the bullet.

Such a great value for so much less. I was obsessed with obsessed with the mighty patches put they get really expensive for not a lot especially when you have a lot of pimples. Personally I get really deep painful pimples that last forever these take them away just leashing the little red mark like the patches do. So impressed with this product and the value. Love it so much and could not recommend this more.

We put The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch to the test after receiving a complimentary sample from the brand. Keep reading for our full product review. 

Editor’s Note: We reviewed this article on September 24, 2023. As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.

Period, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren't blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month. 

Lucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I'll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.

Keep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.

COSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH

BEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types

KEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid

PRICE: $19

ABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.

About My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts

My skin can be unpredictable. But, as I've gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.  

Ingredients: One key, familiar ingredient 

The tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.

The Feel: Like a bandage

You can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Packaging: Easy to store

The 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish

I placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.

Even with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn't budge overnight.

If you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn't expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn't gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don't believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Value: Worth it

Was this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

Similar Products: You've got options 

squish. Flower Power Acne Patches ($14): This pack of 20 floral hydrocolloid pimple patches to help zap blemishes overnight and let's face it, they're pretty darn cute. Pimple, but make them pretty. 

Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Variety Pack ($7): These 36 count medical-grade, chemical-free, allergy-tested patches stay put no matter how much you toss and turn throughout the night. 

Final Verdict

If you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won't regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.

Pimple Patch 101: The Do's and Don'ts of Pimple Patches

by Wendy Kim on Aug 29, 2022

Why is everyone talking about pimple patches? Read the full guide on pimple patch from the best time to use them and 5 common mistakes to avoid when using a pimple patch! Also, find our 6 NEW Acne Sets that are focused to heal your acne from active to post 

01. What is it made from?

Pimple patches are made of a hydrocolloid material. This hydrocolloid material is nothing new, especially in the medical field. They are commonly used to help heal post-surgical wounds by speeding up the healing process. From their amazing benefits in healing wounds, the beauty industry adapts and creates small-sized patches made from the same materials to help speed up the acne healing process.  




According to board-certified dermatologist Sheilagh Maguiness, MD, acne patches typically contain hydrocolloid gel,1 which is often used in wound care. In addition to healing blemishes, Dr. Maguiness notes, "The hydrocolloid in the acne sticker can help absorb sebum and dirt."

02. How does it work?

But what exactly are pimple patches? Acne stickers, another name for pimple patches, are small, usually circular hydrocolloid sheets, which are bandages that trap moisture. They adhere to the skin and absorb excess fluid like oil and dirt away from pimples, explained Hadley King, MD, a board-certified dermatologist.  

03. Some common mistakes to avoid while using pimple patches
04. When should you use a pimple patch and how to use it?

Hydrocolloid acne pimple patches are created for the end-stage of your inflammatory pimple, where you can observe the yellow pus (pustules) at the end of your pimple. This means that the inflammatory process has subsided, and it only leaves you with the remaining debris and pus.  Sooner or later, the top layer of your skin will eventually break, and people usually refer to this as a pimple "pop". Reinfection causes more inflammation and indirectly increases the chance of scarring/hyperpigmentation. That's why a pimple patch will help you cover it up, absorb the excess pus and protect them from the invasion of other acne-causing bacteria. You can also put your hydrocolloid pimple patches on your whiteheads. It will help absorb excess sebum trapped under a pile of dead skin cells, although it is not an effective way to get rid of them since whiteheads most often come in clusters in larger areas that acne patches can't cover.

Tips for how to use an acne patch
Make sure to clean your face and hands before you apply them.
Pick the size that best fits the whole lesion in the center of the patch.
Gently stick them on dry skin as the first step of your routine, especially for hydrocolloid patches.
Let them sit for at most 24 hours or until the patches turn into an opaque color.
When they’ve turned opaque, you know they’ve sucked out the debris from the pores.


05. best acne patches and main ingredient

Hydrocolloid is the ingredient that is often found in pimple patches for acne wond protection and scar prevention. However, there are other ingredients that you can find among certain acne patches which will even make your acne healing and scar prevention easier. 

As Dr. Wolinsky notes, "Some of these patches have salicylic acid, which may help further treat a nasty breakout"

Additionally, you might see soothing aloe vera extract, resurfacing retinol, complexion-clearing tea tree oil, or hydrating hyaluronic acid on the ingredients list.

COSRX Acne pimple Master Patch

The best selling acne patch from COSRX are hydrocolloid patches that protect wounded or troubled area from getting worse while maintaining humidity of skin to prevent further breakouts. You will find 3 different sizes of patches and this is a great merit when it comes to acne patches because guess what? Our dear pimples never come in same sizes when they decide to make a visit to our skin. So having the option of different sizes of patches will be effective for acne spots care.

I have only ever used patches for a short period of time - usually spot fills up again and have to let it scabover and heal naturally - I haveparticularly nasty spot covered with patch now, question is if I keep it covered and keep changing patches will the skin heal underneath? Or do you need to expose to air and let it scabover to heal? I dont want to prolong the agony if I have to put up with a scab anyway!

I once got a lot of acne around the end of my school year on my cheeks and my temples despite regularly washing my face everday (facewash and moisturizer), and it was the largest breakout I've ever had. It stayed for about three months until I saw this tiktok saying Vaseline actually works really well. Then I did a quick search on google and google said it worked (which isnt really a very reliable ig, but I didnt really care), so I ended up trying it. It worked after two weeks of putting Vaseline on my face after using my facewash every night, and worked so fast that the results were obvious. I dont think any other factors were the cause of my rapidly reduced acne because my routine still stayed the same. So, you can try that i guess. Also make sure to keep yourself hydrated and moisturized.

my mum buys some facewash and pimple cream from some beautician she knows and I use it
my pimples do not improve significantly though, it mostly depends on my hormone level and whether it's nearing that time of the month
another reason I have acne is because I lie on one side of the bed

I wash my face 2 times a day because my face gets fairly oily
and when those under skin acne pop up I slather a thick layer of pimple cream
occasionally when I'm free I squeeze them with tissues though I know it makes them scar

I'm experimenting with some facewashes rn to see what helps

also... I heard somewhere that passing motion helps

I bought cleansers acne patches to help out since I've been breaking out badly. I sweat a lot and the masks certainly don't help, especially since I'm half dead and a sweaty mess by the time I reach my class.

Although I still have acne it's not as bad as before. What helped me out was washing my face day and night and applying moisturizer. Moisturizer really helps out.

Definitely try Curology or buy the Ordinary products. I've tried both and they both work well. I currently use a the Ordinary face mask and common drug store moisturizer and cleansers, and there's been a noticeable difference. I also saw someone mention vaseline, but I suggest you be careful with that since it can clog your pores.

Isn't popping them making it worse?


I'm sure there's some medicine or therapy for it...if it's too big see doctor they'd clean it out properly.

Usual causes of acne are stress, bad hygiene and/or diet. Try to change your beddings regularly too. If changing these things for the better still don't help, then you could only blame your parents for your genetics. Also don't expect immediate results, be patient and be consistent.

I didn't have those, just pimples that don't leave scars. I always popped them despite being said it's better to leave them, just make sure it's clean afterwards with alchocol.
I stopped eating unhealthy food that causes pimples as much as I can, things like milk chocolate(I prefer dark one anyway), ketchup and other similary industrially over processed foods.
Also found Neutrogena clear and defend rapid gel. Instead of waiting for days until the white head appears, you can pop a pimple in a single day, then just wipe with alchocol which also dries and reduces it.

yeah guess so, what's wrong with backne tho? not like it's controllable

I didn't have those, just pimples that don't leave scars. I always popped them despite being said it's better to leave them, just make sure it's clean afterwards with alchocol.
I stopped eating unhealthy food that causes pimples as much as I can, things like milk chocolate(I prefer dark one anyway), ketchup and other similary industrially over processed foods.
Also found Neutrogena clear and defend rapid gel. Instead of waiting for days until the white head appears, you can pop a pimple in a single day, then just wipe with alchocol which also dries and reduces it.
ok! got it! thanks!!!

Mine flare up with caffeine intake, so I try to refrain from as many carbonated drinks and coffee, as much as possible. Dunno if it works for you.
Also, try not to let sweat dry on your face, and wash frequently, since acne mostly is due to sweat clogging up the pores leading to sebum accumulation

Esp the one that hurt....
For me, i esp destroy them, y'know the thing and it left me with small scars everywhere around my chin..usually it appears there.
I don't usually have this acne but i guess wearing mask all the time makes it this way....
I usually consult with a dermatologist. But for emergency, i use bandaids/acne patches to cover the most offending spot. It's quite effective for me, since the patch keep my hands away, conceal the redness, while also suck the liquid inside those acnes out without the need to pop them and thus, reduce the swelling. But, i need to change it several times a day. After 3-4 days of acne patches, the swelling part usually gonna get pretty tame.
But again, what work for me might not work for you.
(Juust a disclaimer, I'm no doctor and this is not a medical advice )

don't have any, if I do get it I guess I just ignore it. Don't think too much about it, but if it's severe go to the derma. My skin used to be crystal clear that I used to get regularly get compliments for it, but a year ago, it started acting up. It's okay now, but I don't think it's as clear as it used to be. Oh well

This is what I do... really helps control
1. Drinking a lot of water
2. Drinking healthy tea (like chrysanthemum tea, 涼茶) / avoid unhealthy foods (actually tbh I don't really do this right now cause I'm a little piggy. But it helps if you have will power to change eating habits.)
3. Change pillowcase everyday + wash blanket cover / sheets once a week
4. Consistent skin care routine. Right now I am using oil cleanser + regular foam cleanser, I'm From Mugwort set, and cosrx AHA and BHA serums.

We put The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch to the test after receiving a complimentary sample from the brand. Keep reading for our full product review. 

Editor’s Note: We reviewed this article on September 24, 2023. As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.

Period, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren't blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month. 

Lucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I'll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.

Keep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.

COSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH

BEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types

KEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid

PRICE: $19

ABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.

About My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts

My skin can be unpredictable. But, as I've gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.  

Ingredients: One key, familiar ingredient 

The tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.

The Feel: Like a bandage

You can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Packaging: Easy to store

The 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish

I placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.

Even with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn't budge overnight.

If you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn't expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn't gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don't believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Value: Worth it

Was this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

Similar Products: You've got options

Final Verdict

If you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won't regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.

Q: For those who aren’t familiar, what is Hero Cosmetics?

A: Hero Cosmetics is a functional skincare brand with a mission to create a pimple solution for every pimple problem. We’re most known for our Mighty Patch pimple patches, which is a hydrocolloid patch that absorbs the gunk out of whiteheads to flatten pimples and speed up the skin’s healing. You might have seen us on TikTok, where we have 441.1 million views under #mightypatch and 391.8 million views under #herocosmetics. A box of the Mighty Patch sells every two seconds.

A: Our Mighty Patch products are made of hydrocolloid. Different brands have different recipes and Hero has a super special and owned recipe that is medical grade. We work with a supplier who owns the process end-to-end. All this allows us to create Mighty Patch, which is the number-one acne patch in the U.S. with over 100,000 five-star reviews. In addition, the gentle-yet-effective approach to acne care, as well as providing solutions for the entire pimple lifecycle, is what sets Hero apart from the larger acne care category.

Pimples are common and often a teenager’s worst nightmare. Waking up to a conspicuous red spot on your face could not be more horrifying. So, what to do with these small, painful, discolored bumps with a thick, white-yellow fluid (pus) at the tip?

The Difference Between Acne and Pimples

Commonly known as spots or zits, pimples are a part of acne. The dreaded pimples surface because of hormone production changes during puberty. When hormones become active during puberty, sebaceous glands located at the base of hair follicles may become overstimulated.  Sebaceous (oil) glands are microscopic glands found in your hair follicles that secrete sebum, an oily substance that protects your skin from drying out. Pimples form when dead skin cells mix with excess oil (sebum). This mixture plugs the pore, causing swelling. Bacteria can grow in the mix and lead to infection and pus. Pimples are most likely to occur during the teenage years and, for women, around menstruation.


The clearest way to distinguish between acne and pimples is to understand that pimples are a symptom of a condition, whereas acne is the condition itself, an inflammatory disorder of the skin. Someone who has acne-prone skin will experience pimples as a part of their condition; however, not everyone who gets the occasional pimple has acne-prone skin.

Pimple Patches

What do you do about pimples? You’re told not to pop, squeeze, or pick at the blemish. Popping a pimple delays the natural healing process. It can cause infection and scarring, and it may make the pimple more inflamed and noticeable.  Fortunately, technology has a solution, and that solution is pimple patches. Pimple patches are also known as acne stickers.

A pimple patch is an adhesive sticker that you apply directly to a pimple and leave on for a stretch of time to reduce the breakout. 

To use pimple patches, first clean and moisturize your face as normal. Then apply the sticker to your pimple and wear it overnight. You can keep it on while you shower, as it is waterproof, then wash your face as you would during your usual morning routine.

There are several brands of pimple patches, as well as ingredients used to treat the pimples themselves. A pimple patch is designed for one-time use since the capacity of agents to absorb oils is limited. The actual patch is disposable due to the biodegradable materials used in its production. One film of pimple patches typically consists of up to 15 patches.

Pimple patches can help pimples go away overnight. These spot treatments act as a bandage that prevents you from touching them and absorbs the fluid from the pimples, creating a moist environment for faster and improved healing. The patch won’t stop the next pimple from appearing, but the pimple can be fixed more quickly.

Don't pick of squeeze!

How the Patches Work

Chemically, how do the patches actually work? Pimple patches are commonly made of hydrocolloid, a gel-forming material originally used for healing wounds. Hydrocolloids are a heterogenous group of long-chain polymers that can be polysaccharides or proteins. Hydrocolloid just means a polymeric material that absorbs water to form a gel. The polymers used as hydrocolloids have a number of hydroxyl (-OH) groups that markedly increase their affinity for binding water.

This is a typical hydrocolloid called carboxymethylcellulose.  The orange sections are places where hydrogen bonding can occur with water molecules. This is especially true for the OH groups and the O-Na+ groups.

The application of self-adhesive hydrocolloid dressings is most commonly associated with the treatment of chronic ulcerative conditions where an open wound develops on the skin from injury, poor circulation, or pressure sores. Hydrocolloid dressings may also offer benefits in the care of acute wounds of all types.

For the small wound on your face, the pimple patches are little dressings. Hydrocolloid dressings consist of a thick, self-adhesive layer of a gellable mass that is applied to a flexible polyurethane film. Hydrocolloid dressings are made up of two layers.

The inner lining is usually made of hydrocolloids such as carboxymeth-ylcellulose, gelatin or pectin with with many water-binding groups in the chemical structure. The water-attracting material draws out fluid from the wound. The tough, outer layer is usually polyurethane, a thin transparent material that is easy to peel off.

The outer layer keeps everything in place, as well as preventing the water from evaporating and drying out the wound. The wound heals faster, and the new skin that forms is supple rather than tight and stiff. It also protects the wound from rubbing and scratching on surfaces.

Patches that only contain hydrocolloid are known as nonmedicated patches. 

“As the hydrocolloid gel adheres to the skin, it absorbs excess oil and dirt away from pimples,” said Hadley King, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist. Nonmedicated hydrocolloid patches may be worn for two to three days, as long as you change the patch every day.

The hydrocolloid dressings are available in many shapes and some also have an additional adhesive border to prevent leakage or sliding of the dressing over the wound. Adhesives are used to attach the patch to the face.

There are three types of adhesives: Acrylic, silicone, and hydrogel. Silicone or hydrogel make the most quality adhesive. It is important to use a high-quality adhesive, so it stays in one place and does not cause irritation to the skin.

The Active Ingredients in Patches

Some pimple patches are full of added acne-fighting ingredients, while others are just hydrocolloid gel patches. 

“The patch, or set of ingredients that will work best, depends on your skin type,” said Orit Markowitz, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Opti Skin in New York City.

Pimple patches may help decrease inflammation, meaning red swollen bumps that sit near the surface of the skin, or give you no results at all. Therefore, many experts believe that these patches work only on a specific type of pimple.

Here are some of the ingredients in pimple patches and how each may affect your skin:

w Salicylic acid: A beta hydroxy acid and popular acne-fighting ingredient in skin care and shampoo, salicylic acid can help unclog pores and remove excess sebum, or oil. Patches containing salicylic acid could be a good option for a fairly inflamed pimple, but they may irritate dryer, sensitive skin.

Tea tree oil or tea tree extract: Similar to salicylic acid, “tea tree oil can be very drying,” said Dr. Markowitz, making it a great tool for drying out pimples, but potentially irritating for sensitive skin. Tea tree oil also kills bacteria and decreases inflammation and redness.
Hyaluronic acid: When spread on pimple patches, this popular skin-care ingredient “helps to hydrate the skin, which helps to prevent drying from salicylic acid,” said King.
Niacinamide: “Another great addition,” Dr. King said, to a pimple patch because it can “improve skin tone and texture, and it has stabilizing effects on the skin’s barrier function, which can help improve moisture retention.” Niacinamide is a version of vitamin B3 (niacin).
Benzoyl peroxide: “Benzoyl peroxide is an antiseptic that’s been used to treat acne for decades; however, it is best to avoid it if you have experienced prior irritation to it,” said Marisa Grassick, M.D., a dermatologist at Medical Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery (MDCS) in New York City. Benzoyl peroxide helps reduce breakouts by acting as an antiseptic, killing bacteria in and around the pimple.
Salicylic acid, Benzoyl Peroxide, and Niacinamide
Types of Patches

Use a hydrocolloid bandage if your pimple is raised or has visible pus, so it can drain the fluid and flatten the pimple. 

“These patches are effective because they absorb excess fluid and have a vacuum-like effect that gets out any dirt and oil that could be causing a breakout,” said Debra Jaiman, M.D., a New York City dermatologist and the author of Skin Rules. “It then converts those impurities into a gel-like substance that sticks to the patch and is sealed away from the face.”

If your pimple is too wet, however, it can keep the bandage from adhering. If your pimple doesn’t have any fluid in it, a hydrocolloid patch won’t do much. 

“Pimple patches that contain ingredients that help treat the breakout, like salicylic acid, might deliver some extra help to clear dirt and bacteria out of pores and speed clearing,” said Dr. Jaiman.

Another type of pimple patch is the microneedle patch. It has several tiny, fine spikes that help deliver the active ingredients deeper into the skin. The arrangement is relatively more effective due to better delivery of skin-care ingredients. The active ingredients are able to more easily reach the site allowing the skin cells to absorb them.

Ideal for blind pimples, which are deep bumps that form under the skin. They can be nearly invisible, small, or large, red, and painful.

Popular and Efficient

According to Brendan Camp, M.D., a dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology, pimple patches are seeing a rise in popularity for several reasons, such as “the increase in COVID masking, or the result of excess acne-causing bacteria in the area of the face that lies underneath a standard face mask, that is, the nose, cheeks, and chin. In addition, the self-care movement has taken off as more people spend time at home and find ways to better themselves and their skin.”

Pimple patches are also convenient, replacing a thick lotion or gel over the pimples for a skin-colored patch and making the breakout less visible. The market for pimple patches was valued at $510 million in 2021, indicating their prevalent use and convenience.

All things considered, pimple patches are popular and efficient.

As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.\n\nPeriod, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren\'t blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month.\xa0\n\nLucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I\'ll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.\n\nKeep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.\n\nCOSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH\n\nBEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types\n\nKEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid\n\nPRICE: $19\n\nABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.\n\nAbout My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts\n\nMy skin can be unpredictable. But, as I\'ve gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.\xa0\xa0\n\nIngredients: One key, familiar ingredient\xa0\n\nThe tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.\n\nThe Feel: Like a bandage\n\nYou can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Packaging: Easy to store\n\nThe 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish\n\nI placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.\n\nEven with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn\'t budge overnight.\n\nIf you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn\'t expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn\'t gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don\'t believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Value: Worth it\n\nWas this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nSimilar Products: You\'ve got options\xa0\n\nsquish.

So, what to do with these\xa0small, painful, discolored bumps with a thick, white-yellow\xa0fluid (pus) at the tip?\n\nThe Difference Between Acne and Pimples\n\nCommonly known as spots or zits, pimples are a part of acne. The dreaded pimples surface because of hormone production changes during puberty. When hormones become active during puberty, sebaceous glands located at the base of hair follicles may become overstimulated.\xa0 Sebaceous (oil) glands are microscopic glands found in your hair follicles that secrete sebum, an oily substance that protects your skin from drying out. Pimples form when dead skin cells mix with excess oil (sebum). This mixture plugs the pore, causing swelling. Bacteria can grow in the mix and lead to infection and pus. Pimples are most likely to occur during the teenage years and, for women, around menstruation.\n\n\nThe clearest way to distinguish between acne and pimples is to understand that pimples are a symptom of a condition, whereas acne is the condition itself, an inflammatory disorder of the skin. Someone who has acne-prone skin will experience pimples as a part of their condition; however, not everyone who gets the occasional pimple has acne-prone skin.\n\nPimple Patches\n\nWhat do you do about pimples? You’re\xa0told not to pop, squeeze, or pick at the blemish. Popping a pimple delays the natural healing process. It can cause infection and scarring, and it may make the pimple more inflamed and noticeable.\xa0 Fortunately, technology has a solution, and that solution is pimple patches. Pimple patches are also known as acne stickers.\n\nA pimple patch is an adhesive sticker that you apply directly to a pimple and leave on for a stretch of time to reduce the breakout.\xa0\n\nTo use pimple patches, first clean and moisturize your face as normal. Then apply the sticker to your pimple and wear it overnight. You can keep it on while you shower, as it is waterproof, then wash your face as you would during your usual morning routine.\n\nThere are several brands of pimple patches, as well as ingredients used to treat the pimples themselves. A pimple patch is designed for one-time use since the capacity of agents to absorb oils is limited. The actual patch is disposable due to the biodegradable materials used in its production. One film of pimple patches typically consists of up to 15 patches.\n\nPimple patches can help pimples go away overnight. These spot treatments act as a bandage that prevents you\xa0from touching them and absorbs the fluid from the pimples, creating a moist environment for faster and improved healing. The patch won’t stop the next pimple from appearing, but the pimple can be fixed more quickly.\n\nDon\'t pick of squeeze!\nCredit: Shutterstock\n\nHow the Patches Work\n\nChemically, how do the patches actually work? Pimple patches are commonly made of hydrocolloid, a gel-forming material originally used for healing wounds. Hydrocolloids are a heterogenous group of long-chain polymers that can be polysaccharides or proteins. Hydrocolloid just\xa0means a polymeric material that absorbs water to form\xa0a gel. The polymers used as hydrocolloids have a number of hydroxyl (-OH) groups that markedly increase their affinity for binding water.\n\nThis is a typical hydrocolloid called carboxymethylcellulose.\xa0 The orange sections are places where hydrogen bonding can occur\xa0with water molecules. This is especially true for the OH groups and the O-Na+ groups.\nCredit: Lamberti\n\n\nThe application of self-adhesive hydrocolloid dressings is most commonly associated with the treatment of chronic ulcerative conditions where an open wound develops on the skin from injury, poor circulation, or pressure sores. Hydrocolloid dressings may also offer benefits in the care of acute wounds of all types.\n\nFor the small wound on your face, the pimple patches are little dressings. Hydrocolloid dressings consist of a thick, self-adhesive layer of a gellable mass that is applied to a flexible polyurethane film. Hydrocolloid dressings are made up of two layers.\n\nThe inner lining is usually made of hydrocolloids such as carboxymeth-ylcellulose, gelatin or pectin with with many water-binding groups in the chemical structure. The water-attracting material draws out fluid from the wound. The tough, outer layer is usually polyurethane, a thin transparent material that is easy to peel off.\n\nThe outer layer keeps everything in place, as well as preventing the water from evaporating and drying out the wound. The wound heals faster, and the new skin that forms is supple rather than tight and stiff. It also protects the wound from rubbing and scratching on surfaces.\n\nPatches that only contain hydrocolloid are known as nonmedicated patches.\xa0\n\n“As the hydrocolloid gel adheres to the skin, it absorbs excess oil and dirt away from pimples,” said Hadley King, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist. Nonmedicated hydrocolloid patches may be worn for two to three days, as long as you change the patch every day.\n\nThe hydrocolloid dressings are available in many shapes and some also have an additional adhesive border to prevent leakage or sliding of the dressing over the wound. Adhesives are used to attach the patch to the face.\n\nThere are three types of adhesives: Acrylic, silicone, and hydrogel. Silicone or hydrogel make the most quality adhesive. It is important to use a high-quality adhesive, so it stays in one place and does not cause irritation to the skin.\n\nThe Active Ingredients in Patches\n\nSome pimple patches are full of added acne-fighting ingredients, while others are just hydrocolloid gel patches.\xa0\n\n“The patch, or set of ingredients that will work best, depends on your skin type,” said Orit Markowitz, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Opti Skin in New York City.\n\nPimple patches may help decrease inflammation, meaning red swollen bumps that sit near the surface of the skin, or give you no results at all. Therefore, many experts believe that these patches work only on a specific type of pimple.\n\nHere are some of the ingredients in pimple patches and how each may affect your skin:\n\nw Salicylic acid: A beta hydroxy acid and popular acne-fighting ingredient in skin care and shampoo, salicylic acid can help unclog pores and remove excess sebum, or oil. Patches containing salicylic acid could be a good option for a fairly inflamed pimple, but they may irritate dryer, sensitive skin.\n\nTea tree oil or tea tree extract: Similar to salicylic acid, “tea tree oil can be very drying,” said Dr. Markowitz, making it a great tool for drying out pimples, but potentially irritating for sensitive skin. Tea tree oil also kills bacteria and decreases inflammation and redness.\nHyaluronic acid: When spread on pimple patches, this popular skin-care ingredient “helps to hydrate the skin, which helps to prevent drying from salicylic acid,” said King.\nNiacinamide: “Another great addition,” Dr. King said, to a pimple patch because it can “improve skin tone and texture, and it has stabilizing effects on the skin’s barrier function, which can help improve moisture retention.” Niacinamide is a version of vitamin B3 (niacin).\nBenzoyl peroxide: “Benzoyl peroxide is an antiseptic that’s been used to treat acne for decades; however, it is best to avoid it if you have experienced prior irritation to it,” said Marisa Grassick, M.D., a dermatologist at Medical Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery (MDCS) in New York City. Benzoyl peroxide helps reduce breakouts by acting as an antiseptic, killing bacteria in and around the pimple.\nSalicylic acid, Benzoyl Peroxide, and Niacinamide\nTypes of Patches\n\nUse a hydrocolloid bandage if your pimple is raised or has visible pus, so it can drain the fluid and flatten the pimple.\xa0\n\n“These patches are effective because they absorb excess fluid and have a vacuum-like effect that gets out any dirt and oil that could be causing a breakout,” said Debra Jaiman, M.D., a New York City dermatologist and the author of Skin Rules. “It then converts those impurities into a gel-like substance that sticks to the patch and is sealed away from the face.”\n\nIf your pimple is too wet, however, it can keep the bandage from adhering. If your pimple doesn’t have any fluid in it, a hydrocolloid patch won’t do much.\xa0\n\n“Pimple patches that contain ingredients that help treat the breakout, like salicylic acid, might deliver some extra help to clear dirt and bacteria out of pores and speed clearing,” said Dr. Jaiman.\n\nAnother type of pimple patch is the microneedle patch. It has several tiny, fine spikes that help deliver the active ingredients deeper into the skin. The arrangement is relatively more effective due to better delivery of skin-care ingredients. The active ingredients are able to more easily reach the site allowing the skin cells to absorb them.\n\nTypes of Pimple Patches\nHydrocolloid\n(nonmedicated)\n\nCoated with gel-forming agents that help to form moistness around the problem area and draw excess oil and pus out of the pimple.\nUseful for blemishes that have come to a head and are ready to pop.\n\nMedicated\n\nInfused with ingredients that\xa0have mild medical properties.\n\nTargets bacteria and\xa0inflammation.\n\nMicroneedling\n\nEquipped with several tiny, fine spikes that help deliver the active ingredients deeper into the skin.\nIdeal for blind pimples, which are deep bumps that form under the skin.

We’re most known for our Mighty Patch pimple patches, which is a hydrocolloid patch that absorbs the gunk out of whiteheads to flatten pimples and speed up the skin’s healing. You might have seen us on TikTok, where we have 441.1 million views under #mightypatch and 391.8 million views under #herocosmetics. A box of the Mighty Patch sells every two seconds.\n\nQ: What makes it unique?\n\nA: Our Mighty Patch products are made of hydrocolloid. Different brands have different recipes and Hero has a super special and owned recipe that is medical grade. We work with a supplier who owns the process end-to-end. All this allows us to create Mighty Patch, which is the number-one acne patch in the U.S. with over 100,000 five-star reviews. In addition, the gentle-yet-effective approach to acne care, as well as providing solutions for the entire pimple lifecycle, is what sets Hero apart from the larger acne care category.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content\n\nQ: Who is the target customer?\n\nA: Hero is for anybody who deals with acne.

It’s the first patch we launched with and everybody loves it. For daytime wear, I’d recommend Mighty Patch Invisible+, which can be worn virtually invisibly.

Finally, if you have blackheads and blemishes on your nose, Mighty Patch Nose is the perfect solution to dissolve and absorb all that grime.\n\nQ: What is the price range?\n\nA: Our offering is priced between $14.99 and $33.99 to keep our products accessible for everybody.\n\nQ: And where can people check them out?\n\nA: Hero’s Mighty Patch Original, Mighty Patch Invisible+, Mighty Patch Surface, and Mighty Patch Nose are available across the country at Shoppers Drug Mart and Walmart, and available online through Amazon.ca.\n\nAharris@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nShare this Story : Style Q&A: Mighty Patch co-founder talks taking care of pimple problems\n  Copy Link\n Email\n Facebook\n Twitter\n Reddit\n Pinterest\n LinkedIn\n Tumblr\nComments\n\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion and encourage all readers to share their views on our articles.

Live by Acne Patches? Dermatologists Share the Best 15 Brands of 2023

With faves from Hero Cosmetics, Peace Out, Clearasil, and more.

BYRDIE / JACLYN MASTROPASQUA

There's no shortage of over-the-counter products for clearing breakouts. But when you only have one or two zits at any given time, there's no need to treat your entire face. Enter the pimple patch, a targeted way to zap acne without exposing the rest of your skin to undue drying or irritation. According to board-certified dermatologist Sheilagh Maguiness, MD, acne patches typically contain hydrocolloid gel,1 which is often used in wound care. Hydrocolloid patches are able to keep the spot moist in order to accelerate healing and protect. In addition to healing blemishes, Dr. Maguiness notes, "The hydrocolloid in the acne sticker can help absorb sebum and dirt." 

Claire Wolinsky, MD, a New York dermatologist specializing in facial rejuvenation, says she loves pimple patches and recommends them frequently: "One reason they are particularly helpful in treating acne is because once covered, patients can't pick or squeeze their pimple, which reduces the risk of infection and bacteria." And with less trauma to the skin, Dr. Wolinsky says you're less likely to experience scarring or discoloration.

We conducted hours of research on the best acne patches, evaluating each on active ingredients to target acne as well as ingredients to soothe skin and prevent redness. We also looked at things like how easy they are to apply and how well they stay on. After considering dozens of brands and consulting with two celebrity dermatologists, we landed on the following best in show.

Celebrity aesthetician Joshua Ross of SkinLab stands behind Peace Out Acne Healing Dots. "They employ hydrocolloid2 technology that helps extract impurities and guards against external elements," he explains. What's more, the patches create a barrier between pimples and your bacteria-laden fingers while delivering a time-released infusion of ingredients.

Cosmetic nurse Kristina Kitsos is also a fan of Peace Out. "They contain salicylic acid,3 which penetrates pores to target acne blemishes and blackheads," she tells Byrdie. Additionally, Kitsos appreciates that these acne patches contain soothing aloe vera to minimize redness and skin-clearing standby vitamin A (aka retinol).4 She says that since they're formulated with hydrating ingredients, the skin is able to heal quicker and better than if a drying, alcohol formula was used.

Who It's For

If you have skin that dries out or breaks easily, this is a great pick because of the inclusion of aloe vera—which can soothe and hydrate. Even pimple patches can sometimes tear the sensitive skin around a blemish, but you won't have to worry about that with these.

Thinner patch than other options

While most pimple patches aren't very pricey, The Klog's Soft Shield is one of the budget-friendliest of the bunch. Containing vegan hydrocolloid,2 the protective yet breathable barrier draws out impurities and helps your zits heal as quickly as possible. We love that these super-thin patches are almost invisible—perfect for wear during the day. They're unnoticeable whether you're in a virtual meeting or on a walk, and they'll keep your skin shielded from bacteria (and your fingers).

Who It's For

These pimple patches can be super helpful for those who find it hard to stop themselves from picking since they are so lightweight they can be worn anytime. They're also great for people on a budget or for those looking for a vegan formula patch.

A few drugstore brands have hopped on the pimple-patch bandwagon, but the best iteration comes from acne-fighting all-star Clearasil. Stick on the Spot Patches before bed, get your beauty sleep, and wake up to noticeable improvements in the size and redness of your blemishes. These patches have thinner, smooth edges, so they're able to adhere to the skin better without budging.

Who It's For

If you're a wild sleeper and often wake up to your pimple patch on your pillow, we recommend these.

What We Don't Like

Doesn't contain hydrocolloid

Peter Thomas Roth's take on the acne patch is the super-moisturizing Invisible Dots. In addition to acne-clearing mainstays salicylic acid5 and tea tree oil,6 they call on hyaluronic acid7 to deliver much-needed moisture to the bumps that lie beneath. These aren't hydrocolloid patches, so they won't absorb the gunk out of a pimple that's already come to a head.

Who It's For

We recommend these patches for big, red pimples that you want to reduce in size quickly. They can work overnight to greatly shrink blemishes.

What We Don't Like

More effective on pimples that have come to a head

Dr. Wolinsky is a fan of COSRX Master Patches, and we're here for it. Serving up a heaping dose of hydrocolloid8 underneath each hygienic sticker, you can target even the most stubborn bumps with little effort. We also like that these Korean patches come in three different sizes.

When we tested them for ourselves, we loved that they didn't budge while we slept (even when applied over our nighttime serums). The pimple was noticeably smaller in the morning, and the patches kept the blemish from becoming irritated during use.

Who It's For

These patches come in three different sizes to best fit whatever type of pimple you have. This is a great choice if you deal with frequent acne of all kinds and need a patch that can fit both smaller and larger blemishes.

Small amount of patches

There's not much you can do about a deep pimple brewing underneath your skin—outside of placing a ZitSticka on it. The self-dissolving microdarts get to the root of the problem and prevent bumps from getting any bigger. With continued use, the blemish will become smaller without leaving a scar behind.

Who It's For

We recommend these patches for those with cystic acne that refuses to come to a head, as the mini microneedles can target the deep pimples that sit under the skin.

When it comes to pimple patches, Dr. Maguiness and Dr. Wolinsky agree on the Mighty Patch. A home run for all skin types, this pack of acne patches includes a flat, invisible option for daytime and a more conspicuous overnight sticker, each containing hydrocolloid8 to expedite healing and prevent acne scarring. They work quickly (in about 6 hours) to noticeably flatten the spot so that a scar doesn't have time to appear.

Who It's For

If you have blemishes that easily scar even when you don't pick or prod at them, we love these patches that can help stop scars from forming.

When you're dealing with hormonal acne, standard pimple patches often aren't able to reach the nodules under the skin, which can be painful and difficult to get rid of. These patches are the ones that you'll want to try to get those hard-to-reach blemishes. It has a two-step process: swipe the pad (which is infused with tea tree oil and salicylic acid) on clean skin and then apply the patch directly to the blemish. It's made with super-fine microneedles so that the ingredients are able to penetrate the skin better, and the patch is also formulated with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and peptides to hydrate and heal the affected area and effectively flatten the pimple.


Who It's For

If you've tried everything for hormonal acne and are looking for a targeted, effective treatment without taking a trip to the dermatologist, these are a great pick. Because of the powerful formula, you should be able to see results overnight.

Pimple patches are usually clear, but you can still often see the thick material—especially on darker skin tones or under makeup. If you have a blemish that you feel the need to conceal during the day, we recommend reaching for these patches from Rael. They have super thin edges that stick onto the skin seamlessly and lay as flat as possible for a hydrocolloid patch. Even though they're less noticeable than others on the market, they're still just as effective at protecting from bacteria and removing impurities from the spot overnight.


Who It's For

Picking at your skin is a hard habit to break, but it's necessary in order to not make blemishes worse and create a scar. Wearing a pimple patch throughout the day can help, and these patches from Rael will go unnoticed while you're out with friends or even at work.

Where We Stand

The best pimple patches overall are Peace Out Acne Healing Dots. They contain hydrocolloid, and also a blend of soothing and clearing ingredients like retinol, salicylic acid, and aloe. For a more affordable option, consider The Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch, a breathable yet protective solution that draws out impurities and speeds up healing.

What to Look for When Buying Acne Patches
Hydrocolloid: "The most important thing is that the stickers or patches are made of hydrocolloid," Dr. Wolinsky tells Byrdie, which is "something dermatologists have used for wound care for a long time." The healing ingredient seals the skin underneath the patch while absorbing fluid, flattening bumps, and minimizing inflammation.8Some options, like Peach Slices Acne Spot Dots, are made with nothing more than hydrocolloid, which does an excellent job taking care of pimples on its own.
Active Ingredients: Most acne patches utilize hydrocolloid, which can be very effective on its own. However, you'll also find options containing a range of other acne-fighting ingredients. As Dr. Wolinsky notes, "Some of these patches have salicylic acid, which may help further treat a nasty breakout." Additionally, you might see soothing aloe vera extract,14 resurfacing retinol,4 complexion-clearing tea tree oil,15 or hydrating hyaluronic acid12 on the ingredients list.
Dime Beauty Power Patches are an excellent choice if you're looking for something containing salicylic acid, and Peter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots are a great option with tea tree oil. Some patches, like Mario Badescu Drying Patches, contain both.
Size: Since pimples and breakouts come in all shapes and sizes, it's nice to have a couple of different acne patches to work with. While many brands offer only one size, some packs include two or even three sizes to cover large and small zits accordingly. For instance, The Klog's Soft Shield Pimple Patches come with two sizes. You'll also find extra-large patches, which are meant to cover multi-bump breakouts.
FAQ
How do acne patches work?

"Most acne patches work by providing a moist occluded environment so that the acne lesion can heal underneath," says Dr. Maguiness. They typically contain hydrocolloid,8 which, as Dr. Wolinsky explains, absorbs the inflammatory fluid, flattens the bump, and speeds up healing. "The added bonus is that they keep fingers off and prevent picking," notes Dr. Maguiness.


How do you apply acne patches?

Starting with freshly washed hands and clean, dry skin, carefully peel the patch off the sheet. Then, gently stick it on the pimple in question, aligning the center of the patch with the center of the pimple. Leave it on for 12 to 24 hours or until it turns opaque.


How often should you use acne patches?

Generally speaking, you can use acne patches as often as needed. Since they target only a very small portion of your skin, you shouldn't have to worry about irritating the rest of your face or neck. In some cases, you might need to use two or three consecutive patches to get rid of a particularly stubborn pimple.

Do Pimple Patches Actually Work?
A dermatologist weighs in on whether zit stickers are worthwhile
FACEBOOK

The cardinal rule of acne is “don’t pick,” but when you’re faced with a whitehead that seems to have its own zip code, sometimes, all logic flies out the window. If you’ve broken the rules (and gone against dermatologists’ advice) by taking matters into your own hands, you may be left with the gory aftermath: An open wound leaking pus, oil and even blood.

Enter pimple patches, sometimes known as zit stickers, which may be able to help soothe your skin in a pinch. Dermatologist Amy Kassouf, MD, explains what these over-the-counter spot treatments can — and can’t — do for your skin troubles.

How do pimple patches work?

Pimple patches are small stickers made with a slightly gummy wound-healing gel called hydrocolloid. Larger versions are marketed as “blister bandages,” but they’re all designed to do the same thing: Help your skin heal faster.

“Pimple patches work by absorbing any drainage from the pimple and covering the wound to prevent further trauma to the site, such as picking,” Dr. Kassouf explains. “They work best on open, draining, healing pustules, papules and cysts.”

Of course, you know you’re not supposed to pick at your skin or pop zits. But if you’ve already committed this skin care sin, a pimple patch may be a helpful healer.

How to use pimple patches

Most pimple patches need to be worn for a few hours in order to do their thing, so you may want to plan to apply yours before bed. Some versions are also designed to be inconspicuous enough to be worn during the day.

Before applying your pimple patch, make sure your skin is completely dry, as the patches won’t stick as well to wet skin. If your freshly picked pimple is leaking or oozing, be sure to cleanse the spot before application.

Simply apply the pimple patch over your zit — remember, they only work on open wounds — and leave it on for the recommended amount of time (which varies by product). When you peel it off, your blemish may be smaller and less inflamed.

Can pimple patches make acne worse?

For most people, pimple patches are, at worst, simply unhelpful — which is to say that they won’t make your acne worse, but they won’t make it better, either. If you have sensitive skin, though, you may want to steer clear of pimple patches.

“They do use a bit of adhesive to stick to your skin, so if you’re allergic or sensitive to adhesive, this may aggravate the skin surrounding the lesion,” Dr. Kassouf says.

And some brands use ingredients such as salicylic acid or tea tree oil to dry out pimples, which may also dry or irritate sensitive skin.

What pimple patches can’t do

Though pimple patches can be very effective on existing lesions, they have significant limitations.

“Pimple patches don’t work at all on closed lesions or deeper lesions or even blackheads and whiteheads, which are called comedones,” Dr. Kassouf explains. “They are spot treatments for active bumps and have no ability to prevent acne from coming,” nor can they clear clogged pores or other precursors to acne flares.”

In other words, if you’re struggling with cystic acne, large-scale breakouts or other skin concerns, pimple patches aren’t going to do the trick.

What to try instead of pimple patches

There’s no real harm in using zit stickers — but they may not work, either, leaving you pimply and frustrated. “They’re really just wound healing dressings for a very specific type of lesion,” Dr. Kassouf says. “They can be helpful, but for overall acne treatment, there is little use for them. 

Don’t fret, though. You’ve got options.

“There are a lot of great over-the-counter medications these days that do more for the money,” Dr. Kassouf says.

Adapalene: This vitamin A derivative, available in topical form, can help make skin cells less sticky so they don’t hang around and clog your pores, which can not only help prevent acne but can help heal it, too.
Salicylic acid: This beta hydroxy acid is available in cleansers and topical applications to help exfoliate and clean your skin, as well as decrease acne inflammation. 
Foaming cleansers: These face washes are great for removing dirt and pollutants that can increase inflammation and breakouts.
Emergency treatments: If you have a big event coming up and need to get rid of a major pimple in a hurry, talk to your dermatologist about quick-turnaround options, including cortisone and antibiotic injections.

If your breakouts are related to an underlying issue like a hormonal imbalance, these treatments may not be enough for you. “If hormones are the issue, your dermatologist may have much better options for you,” Dr. Kassouf says.

Bottom line? Pimple patches can be a worthwhile option for certain, minor skin troubles, but don’t expect them to be a cure-all for your skin ailments.

Pros & Cons Of Treating Active Acne Using Pimple Patches

Pimples and acne are problems that we all face at various times in our lives. When it comes to managing active acne, there are various treatments available, including the use of pimple patches. These small, adhesive patches have gained popularity for their ability to target and treat individual pimples. 

Dr Alekya Singapore, Dermatologist and Cosmetologist, and Founder, The Skin Sensé, Skin and Hair Clinics, says that pimple patches can be a valuable addition to your acne management routine, providing targeted treatment and protection. “However, it’s important to understand their limitations and consider them as part of a comprehensive skincare plan. If you experience persistent or severe acne, consulting a dermatologist is crucial for proper diagnosis and personalised treatment recommendations,” he adds.

Read on for the pros and cons of pimple patches, as outlined by Dr Alekya. 

Pros Of Using Pimple Patches 
Offer Targeted Treatment: Pimple patches offer a localised approach, targeting specific pimples. By covering the blemish, the patch creates a protective barrier, preventing further irritation and promoting faster healing. 
Absorb Excess Sebum: Pimple patches are designed to absorb excess sebum (oil) from the pimple, which helps reduce inflammation and the risk of bacterial infection. This can lead to faster resolution and a reduction in redness and swelling. 
Protect From External Factors: Pimple patches act as a physical barrier between the pimple and external factors like dirt, bacteria, and pollutants. This can help prevent further contamination and minimise the risk of scarring. 
They Have A Concealing Effect: Many pimple patches are translucent or skin-toned, allowing for discreet coverage. This can provide a temporary cosmetic solution by concealing the pimple and reducing self-consciousness.

Cons Of Using Pimple Patches 
Have Limited Effectiveness On Deep Or Cystic Acne: Pimple patches work best on surface-level pimples. Deep or cystic acne lesions, which are located beneath the skin’s surface, might not respond as effectively to pimple patches. In such cases, consulting a dermatologist for alternative treatment options is advisable. 
Might Create Dependency And Have Delayed Treatment: Relying solely on pimple patches for acne treatment without addressing the underlying causes might delay appropriate intervention. It’s important to adopt a holistic approach to skincare and consult a dermatologist for a comprehensive acne management plan.
Cause Irritation On Senstive Skin: Pimple patches contain adhesives and ingredients that may cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in some individuals. It’s crucial to read the product label, test a patch on a small area of skin, and discontinue use if any adverse reactions occur. 
Ineffective On Open Or Popped Pimples: Pimple patches are not designed to be used on open or popped pimples. Applying a patch on an open pimple might lead to infection or further irritation. It’s best to allow an open pimple to heal naturally or seek professional advice. 

Dr Alekya emphasises maintaining a consistent skincare routine, practising good hygiene, and adopting a healthy lifestyle, which are key to managing acne effectively.

It stayed for about three months until I saw this tiktok saying Vaseline actually works really well. Then I did a quick search on google and google said it worked (which isnt really a very reliable ig, but I didnt really care), so I ended up trying it. It worked after two weeks of putting Vaseline on my face after using my facewash every night, and worked so fast that the results were obvious. I dont think any other factors were the cause of my rapidly reduced acne because my routine still stayed the same. So, you can try that i guess.

I always popped them despite being said it\'s better to leave them, just make sure it\'s clean afterwards with alchocol.\nI stopped eating unhealthy food that causes pimples as much as I can, things like milk chocolate(I prefer dark one anyway), ketchup and other similary industrially over processed foods.\nAlso found Neutrogena clear and defend rapid gel. Instead of waiting for days until the white head appears, you can pop a pimple in a single day, then just wipe with alchocol which also dries and reduces it.\n\xa0\nJojo775, Oct 13, 2021\n#13\nShizukani\nChronically stressed\nJoined:\nDec 8, 2016\nMessages:\n1,512\nLikes Received:\n16,675\nReading List:\nLink\nDon\'t don\'t destroy themm QAQ No touch!

If changing these things for the better still don\'t help, then you could only blame your parents for your genetics. Also don\'t expect immediate results, be patient and be consistent.\nyeah guess so, what\'s wrong with backne tho? not like it\'s controllable\n\n\nJojo775 said: ↑\nI didn\'t have those, just pimples that don\'t leave scars.

Instead of waiting for days until the white head appears, you can pop a pimple in a single day, then just wipe with alchocol which also dries and reduces it.\nok! got it! thanks!!!\n\xa0\nAlexcia, Oct 13, 2021\n#15\nAmaruna Myu\nugly squid dokja (●´∀｀●)\nJoined:\nAug 28, 2016\nMessages:\n4,401\nLikes Received:\n4,123\nReading List:\nLink\nAlexcia said: ↑\npassing motion? what\'s that? and i also use face wash and night cream regularly.\naka: pooping/shitting/excreting waste/egestion etcetc\nwas trying to make it sound less crude\n\xa0\nAmaruna Myu, Oct 13, 2021\n#16\nDidact\nWell-Known Member\nJoined:\nAug 16, 2021\nMessages:\n44\nLikes Received:\n53\nReading List:\nLink\nMine flare up with caffeine intake, so I try to refrain from as many carbonated drinks and coffee, as much as possible.

As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.\n\nPeriod, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren\'t blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month.\xa0\n\nLucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I\'ll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.\n\nKeep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.\n\nCOSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH\n\nBEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types\n\nKEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid\n\nPRICE: $19\n\nABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.\n\nAbout My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts\n\nMy skin can be unpredictable. But, as I\'ve gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.\xa0\xa0\n\nIngredients: One key, familiar ingredient\xa0\n\nThe tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.\n\nThe Feel: Like a bandage\n\nYou can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Packaging: Easy to store\n\nThe 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish\n\nI placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.\n\nEven with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn\'t budge overnight.\n\nIf you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn\'t expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn\'t gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don\'t believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Value: Worth it\n\nWas this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nSimilar Products: You\'ve got options\xa0\n\nsquish.

Read the full guide on pimple patch from the best time to use them and 5 common mistakes to avoid when using a pimple patch! Also, find our 6 NEW Acne Sets that are focused to heal your acne from active to post\xa0\n\n01. What is it made from?\n\nPimple patches\xa0are made of a hydrocolloid material. This hydrocolloid material is nothing new, especially in the medical field. They are commonly used to help heal post-surgical wounds by speeding up the healing process. From their amazing benefits in healing wounds, the beauty industry adapts and creates small-sized patches made from the same materials to help speed up the acne healing process. \xa0\n\n\n\n\nAccording to board-certified dermatologist Sheilagh Maguiness, MD, acne patches typically contain hydrocolloid gel,1 which is often used in wound care. In addition to healing blemishes, Dr. Maguiness notes, "The hydrocolloid in the acne sticker can help absorb sebum and dirt."\n\n02. How does it work?\n\nBut what exactly are pimple patches? Acne stickers, another name for pimple patches, are small, usually circular hydrocolloid sheets, which are bandages that trap moisture. They adhere to the skin and absorb excess fluid like oil and dirt away from pimples, explained Hadley King, MD, a board-certified dermatologist. \xa0\n\n03. Some common mistakes to avoid while using pimple patches\n04. When should you use a pimple patch and how to use it?\n\nHydrocolloid acne pimple patches are created for the end-stage of your inflammatory pimple, where you can observe the yellow pus (pustules) at the end of your pimple. This means that the inflammatory process has subsided, and it only leaves you with the remaining debris and pus. \xa0Sooner or later, the top layer of your skin will eventually break, and people usually refer to this as a pimple "pop". Reinfection causes more inflammation and indirectly increases the chance of scarring/hyperpigmentation. That\'s why a pimple patch will help you cover it up, absorb the excess pus and protect them from the invasion of other acne-causing bacteria. You can also put your hydrocolloid pimple patches on your whiteheads. It will help absorb excess sebum trapped under a pile of dead skin cells, although it is not an effective way to get rid of them since whiteheads most often come in clusters in larger areas that acne patches can\'t cover.\n\nTips for how to use an acne patch\nMake sure to clean your face and hands before you apply them.\nPick the size that best fits the whole lesion in the center of the patch.\nGently stick them on dry skin as the first step of your routine, especially for hydrocolloid patches.\nLet them sit for at most 24 hours or until the patches turn into an opaque color.\nWhen they’ve turned opaque, you know they’ve sucked out the debris from the pores.\n\n\n05. best acne patches and main ingredient\n\nHydrocolloid is the ingredient that is often found in\xa0pimple patches for acne wond protection and scar prevention. However, there are other ingredients that you can find among certain acne patches which will even make your acne healing and scar prevention\xa0easier.\xa0\n\nAs Dr. Wolinsky notes, "Some of these patches have salicylic acid, which may help further treat a nasty breakout"\n\nAdditionally, you might see soothing aloe vera extract, resurfacing retinol, complexion-clearing tea tree oil, or hydrating hyaluronic acid on the ingredients list.\n\nCOSRX Acne pimple Master Patch\n\nThe best selling acne patch from COSRX are hydrocolloid patches that protect wounded or troubled area from getting worse while maintaining humidity of skin to prevent further breakouts. You will find 3 different sizes of patches and this is a great merit when it comes to acne patches because guess what? Our dear pimples never come in same sizes when they decide to make a visit to our skin. So having the option of different sizes of patches will be effective for acne spots care. \xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nSHOP NOW\n\nCOSRX\n\nAcne Pimple Master Patch\n\n$\n6.00\nClosing with a thank you to our Wishtrenders:\n\nFor almost a year our product development team have reached out to our Wishtrenders through surveys to hear how we can improve the product.

TikTok dermatologists are capitalizing on the trend, posting their reaction to some close-up videos of pimple popping, blackhead squeezing, and cyst squashing, racking up millions of views in their expert dissection of another’s expert dissection.\xa0\n\nWhile watching these videos through half-shut eyes is somewhat satisfying, it’s even more satisfying to experience the ick IRL. Pimple patches allow people to take their overfilled zits into their own hands and experience the visual and physical relief of popping a pimple sans scalpel. Pimple patches have soared in popularity over the last few years, with searches expected to grow 30% over the next 12 months according to Spate.\n\nAcne brands selling pimple patches are tapping into the pimple-popping trend to showcase the effectiveness of their products, and seeing incredible engagement and conversion on these engrossing videos. BeautyMatter spoke to four acne brands to understand how they make the most of this long-standing trend and why they believe it resonates so deeply with their customers and on social.\xa0\n\nPeace Out Skincare has been on a mission to erase the stigma surrounding acne since the brand launched in 2017—long before acne positivity entered the beauty zeitgeist. The brand’s best-selling acne patches were the first on the market to combine active ingredients with a medical grade hydrocolloid polymer, leading to more than 35 million patches sold worldwide. Peace Out’s honest and relatable approach to acne has made the brand wildly popular on TikTok, garnering 90.1K followers and 2.6MM likes.\xa0\n\nThe \u200b\u200b#peaceoutskincare tag has over 26.1MM views, with nearly all of the most popular videos falling into the “oddly satisfying” content category, showing the overfilled pore strips and pimple patches. Junior Pence, Chief Marketing Officer and Creative Director at Peace Out, says that these videos were primarily user-generated in the beginning.\n\n“We got early into understanding the ‘gross’ effect of Peace Out Acne Dots,” says Pence. “It started out as all organic UGC. Our consumers, people that know our brand and love our brand, put it up there themselves.”\n\nPeace Out seeds product to nano and micro influencers, many of whom have posted about the brand before. The brand strives to build and nurture these relationships, believing them to be more fruitful than paid promotions with large influencers.\xa0\n\n“We\'ve always believed that the micro influencer is the number one influencer that you could possibly ever have. It’s all about honesty and integrity,” says Pence. “What we learn from our consumers and our customers when they give us feedback is that they will only trust a nano influencer.”\n\n“We got early into understanding the ‘gross’ effect of Peace Out Acne Dots.”\nBY JUNIOR PENCE, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER + CREATIVE DIRECTOR, PEACE OUT\n\nPence says that the brand only receives positive feedback on the “gross” videos they share of customers using their products. In fact, the videos have been so successful that the brands use them in paid social ads, where they continuously have a click-through rate of around 7%, as opposed to average 3.4%. \xa0\n\n“We\'ve never got pushback on showing the product or being honest about what happens when you use the product because that\'s the benefit of the product, watching the gunk being sucked into the hydrocolloid.”\n\nOne of their more recent viral videos is a 20-second close-up video showing someone removing an acne patch, revealing the juicy inside. The video has racked up over 3.2 million views and over 289,000 likes. Pence says this speaks to the consumer demand for authenticity in marketing, especially in skincare.\xa0\n\n“I think they\'re looking for [brands] to be authentic, and to know that you\'re actually telling the truth about what your product is and what it does. What is the benefit of using this product?” says Pence. “At the end of the day, that\'s the biggest feedback we get. People love our product because it does what it says it does in the least amount of time so that they can go back to feeling good about themselves.”\n\nPeace Out isn’t the only acne brand capitalizing on the popularity of these #oddlysatisfying videos. ZitSticka, a skincare brand known for its acne patches, sees higher engagement on these videos versus others.\n\n“There’s a kind of visceral satisfaction in seeing, say, the contents of your zit extracted or a hyper-macro video of a hair being tweezed,” says Melissa Kenny, Director of Communications at ZitSticka. “It feels almost primal, but also difficult to trace! This category of content definitely arouses a good deal of interest/interaction for ZitSticka on TikTok (as well as Instagram) which might be explained as being cathartic or stress-relieving for some.”\n\nFor COSRX, the Korean skincare brand credited for being the first to market with the iconic Acne Pimple Master Patch, sees a deeper explanation for the popularity of these videos.\n\n“Social media is a diary of our collective unconscious,” a representative from the skincare brand tells BeautyMatter. “The oddly satisfying videos reflect our wider sentiments, preferences, and desires. People can\'t stop watching these satisfying videos because they are projecting themselves onto the person in the video who’s pulling off an acne pimple patch from their skin.”\n\nBioré Skincare is best known for its classic pore strip, which predates the acne patch craze of recent years by at least decade. The Biore tag on TikTok is filled with examples of this trend, garnering over 88 million views. The brand knows exactly why consumers keep coming back to the iconic pore strip: the satisfaction of clean and clear pores.\n\n“There’s something about people sharing their stripping experience—and the gunk that comes with it—that consumers just can’t get enough of,” says Leah Stone, Associate Director of Face Care at Bioré Skincare. “Watching up-close and personal content of others clearing out their pores can evoke feelings of fulfillment and productivity, and can even inspire the viewer to take action when it comes to their own skin. There is also a sense of community when it comes to these videos—they bring a certain comfort to some viewers in knowing they’re not alone in their skin struggles, and all who watch them share that same intrigue and craving for a satisfying experience.”\n\nSonia Elyss, beauty marketing strategist and President and founder of Round Twelve, a digital marketing consultancy, explains why she believes these types of videos overperform on TikTok.\xa0\n\n“While I do believe there is an audience that truly enjoys and feels that odd sense of satisfaction from this up-close-and-personal look at something that is deemed ‘gross,’ many others just have to slow down to watch, even though they truly feel it IS gross,” says Elyss. “Consider the car crash effect. Most people don\'t actually want to see anything gruesome, but everyone slows down to watch! As we watch and rewatch TikTok\'s algorithm picks up on our ‘interest’ in the content distributing it to others on the platform at a faster rate.”\n\nMost people will never experience an extraction worthy of Dr. Pimple Popper, and that’s probably a good thing. But most people will experience the occasional pimple, and when they do, there may be a small part of them that feels giddy at the excuse to see a pimple patch at its fullest potential. Even if you don’t find watching these videos on TikTok #oddlysatisfying, when it happens to you, it’s just plain satisfying.\n\n×\n\n2\nARTICLE(S) REMAINING\n\nSUBSCRIBE TODAY FOR FULL ACCESS\nRELATED\nHERO COSMETICS: RETHINKING ACNE TREATMENTS ONE PATCH AT A TIME\nAPR. 8, 2019\nERNO LASZLO: CAPTURING THE CHINESE MARKET BEAUTY PRIZE\nJAN. 23, 2019\nBEAUTY DISRUPTOR SERIES: SASKIA WILSON-BROWN ON OPEN-ACCESS SCENT\nSEP. 1, 2022\nEXPERIMENT CO-FOUNDERS ON SCIENCE BEAUTY 2.0\nFEB. 19, 2023\nPEACE OUT SKINCARE: FUTURE50 2023\nJUN. 4, 2023\nMOTIF: REPLACING TRENDS WITH SCIENCE AND RAISING THE STANDARDS OF SKINCARE\nSEP. 21, 2023\nExclusives\nARTICLES\nPODCASTS\nREPORTS\nAbout\nABOUT US\nMEMBERSHIPS\nConnect\nADVERTISING + SPONSORSHIPS\nCONTRIBUTORS, TIPS + STORIES\nMEDIA + PRESS INQUIRES\nMore\nMY ACCOUNT\nTERMS\nPRIVACY\nJoin the Newsletter\n\n\nSUBMIT\n\n\n\n     \n\n© BEAUTYMATTER 2023\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nInterested in\n\nthe latest beauty\n\nindustry insights?\n\nYES\nNO\n'}]

If you’ve broken the rules (and gone against dermatologists’ advice) by taking matters into your own hands, you may be left with the gory aftermath: An open wound leaking pus, oil and even blood.\n\nEnter pimple patches, sometimes known as zit stickers, which may be able to help soothe your skin in a pinch. Dermatologist Amy Kassouf, MD, explains what these over-the-counter spot treatments can — and can’t — do for your skin troubles.\n\nHow do pimple patches work?\n\nPimple patches are small stickers made with a slightly gummy wound-healing gel called hydrocolloid. Larger versions are marketed as “blister bandages,” but they’re all designed to do the same thing: Help your skin heal faster.\n\n“Pimple patches work by absorbing any drainage from the pimple and covering the wound to prevent further trauma to the site, such as picking,” Dr. Kassouf explains. “They work best on open, draining, healing pustules, papules and cysts.”\n\nOf course, you know you’re not supposed to pick at your skin or pop zits. But if you’ve already committed this skin care sin, a pimple patch may be a helpful healer.\n\nHow to use pimple patches\n\nMost pimple patches need to be worn for a few hours in order to do their thing, so you may want to plan to apply yours before bed. Some versions are also designed to be inconspicuous enough to be worn during the day.\n\nBefore applying your pimple patch, make sure your skin is completely dry, as the patches won’t stick as well to wet skin. If your freshly picked pimple is leaking or oozing, be sure to cleanse the spot before application.\n\nSimply apply the pimple patch over your zit — remember, they only work on open wounds — and leave it on for the recommended amount of time (which varies by product). When you peel it off, your blemish may be smaller and less inflamed.\n\nCan pimple patches make acne worse?\n\nFor most people, pimple patches are, at worst, simply unhelpful — which is to say that they won’t make your acne worse, but they won’t make it better, either. If you have sensitive skin, though, you may want to steer clear of pimple patches.\n\n“They do use a bit of adhesive to stick to your skin, so if you’re allergic or sensitive to adhesive, this may aggravate the skin surrounding the lesion,” Dr. Kassouf says.\n\nAnd some brands use ingredients such as salicylic acid or tea tree oil to dry out pimples, which may also dry or irritate sensitive skin.\n\nWhat pimple patches can’t do\n\nThough pimple patches can be very effective on existing lesions, they have significant limitations.\n\n“Pimple patches don’t work at all on closed lesions or deeper lesions or even blackheads and whiteheads, which are called comedones,” Dr. Kassouf explains. “They are spot treatments for active bumps and have no ability to prevent acne from coming,” nor can they clear clogged pores or other precursors to acne flares.”\n\nIn other words, if you’re struggling with cystic acne, large-scale breakouts or other skin concerns, pimple patches aren’t going to do the trick.\n\nWhat to try instead of pimple patches\n\nThere’s no real harm in using zit stickers — but they may not work, either, leaving you pimply and frustrated. “They’re really just wound healing dressings for a very specific type of lesion,” Dr. Kassouf says. “They can be helpful, but for overall acne treatment, there is little use for them.\xa0\n\nDon’t fret, though. You’ve got options.\n\n“There are a lot of great over-the-counter medications these days that do more for the money,” Dr. Kassouf says.\n\nAdapalene: This vitamin A derivative, available in topical form, can help make skin cells less sticky so they don’t hang around and clog your pores, which can not only help prevent acne but can help heal it, too.\nSalicylic acid: This beta hydroxy acid is available in cleansers and topical applications to help exfoliate and clean your skin, as well as decrease acne inflammation.\xa0\nFoaming cleansers: These face washes are great for removing dirt and pollutants that can increase inflammation and breakouts.\nEmergency treatments: If you have a big event coming up and need to get rid of a major pimple in a hurry, talk to your dermatologist about quick-turnaround options, including cortisone and antibiotic injections.\n\nIf your breakouts are related to an underlying issue like a hormonal imbalance, these treatments may not be enough for you. “If hormones are the issue, your dermatologist may have much better options for you,” Dr. Kassouf says.\n\nBottom line? Pimple patches can be a worthwhile option for certain, minor skin troubles, but don’t expect them to be a cure-all for your skin ailments.\n\nFACEBOOK\nTWITTER\nLINKEDIN\nPINTEREST\nEmail\nacne acne treatment\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

When it comes to managing active acne, there are various treatments available, including the use of pimple patches. These small, adhesive patches have gained popularity for their ability to target and treat individual pimples.\xa0\n\nDr Alekya Singapore, Dermatologist and Cosmetologist, and Founder, The Skin Sensé, Skin and Hair Clinics, says that pimple patches can be a valuable addition to your acne management routine, providing targeted treatment and protection. “However, it’s important to understand their limitations and consider them as part of a comprehensive skincare plan. If you experience persistent or severe acne, consulting a dermatologist is crucial for proper diagnosis and personalised treatment recommendations,” he adds.\xa0\n\n\n\nImage: Shutterstock\xa0\n\nRead on for the pros and cons of pimple patches, as outlined by Dr Alekya.\xa0\n\nPros Of Using Pimple Patches\xa0\nOffer Targeted Treatment: Pimple patches offer a localised approach, targeting specific pimples. By covering the blemish, the patch creates a protective barrier, preventing further irritation and promoting faster healing.\xa0\nAbsorb Excess Sebum: Pimple patches are designed to absorb excess sebum (oil) from the pimple, which helps reduce inflammation and the risk of bacterial infection. This can lead to faster resolution and a reduction in redness and swelling.\xa0\nProtect From External Factors: Pimple patches act as a physical barrier between the pimple and external factors like dirt, bacteria, and pollutants. This can help prevent further contamination and minimise the risk of scarring.\xa0\nThey Have A Concealing Effect: Many pimple patches are translucent or skin-toned, allowing for discreet coverage. This can provide a temporary cosmetic solution by concealing the pimple and reducing self-consciousness.\xa0\n\n\n\nImage: Shutterstock\xa0\n\nCons Of Using Pimple Patches\xa0\nHave Limited Effectiveness On Deep Or Cystic Acne: Pimple patches work best on surface-level pimples. Deep or cystic acne lesions, which are located beneath the skin’s surface, might not respond as effectively to pimple patches. In such cases, consulting a dermatologist for alternative treatment options is advisable.\xa0\nMight Create Dependency And Have Delayed Treatment: Relying solely on pimple patches for acne treatment without addressing the underlying causes might delay appropriate intervention. It’s important to adopt a holistic approach to skincare and consult a dermatologist for a comprehensive acne management plan.\nCause Irritation On Senstive Skin: Pimple patches contain adhesives and ingredients that may cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in some individuals. It’s crucial to read the product label, test a patch on a small area of skin, and discontinue use if any adverse reactions occur.\xa0\nIneffective On Open Or Popped Pimples: Pimple patches are not designed to be used on open or popped pimples. Applying a patch on an open pimple might lead to infection or further irritation. It’s best to allow an open pimple to heal naturally or seek professional advice.\xa0\n\nDr Alekya emphasises maintaining a consistent skincare routine, practising good hygiene, and adopting a healthy lifestyle, which are key to managing acne effectively.\xa0\n\nRead more: Your Guide To A Minimal Skincare Routine With Minimal Waste\nNEXT STORY :\nThe Simple Yet Effective Skincare Routine You Need\nNEXT STORY\n\nMOST POPULAR IN SKIN\nWEEKLY\nMONTHLY\nYEARLY\n\n25 Incredible Benefits And Uses of Eucalyptus Oil\n\nThe Simple Yet Effective Skincare Routine You Need\n\nFASHION\nCELEB STYLE\nHOW TO\nTRENDS\nFASHION NEWS\nASK THE EXPERT\nFASHION FIRST 2020\n9 YARDS BY FEMINA\nRELATIONSHIPS\nLOVE & SEX\nFRIENDS & FAMILY\nPARENTING\nPETS\nCONFESSIONS\nASK THE EXPERT\nBEAUTY\nHAIR\nSKIN\nMAKE UP\nCELEB LOOK\nPRODUCTS\nDIY\nASK THE EXPERT\n#GLOWCODE\nVIRTUAL BEAUTY CARNIVAL 2023\nBEAUTY AWARDS 2022\nSALON AND SPA\nGROW HAIR NATURALLY\nFOOD\nRECIPES\nINSTANT FIX\nHOW TO\nIMMUNITY BOOSTERS\nSUSTAINABLE KITCHEN\nINDULGE FEST 2020\nINDULGE FEST 2021\nBRIDES\nBRIDAL FASHION\nBRIDAL BEAUTY\nPLANNING & ADVICE\nFEMINA BRIDAL SHOW\nWELLNESS\nDIET\nWEIGHT LOSS\nHOME REMEDIES\nGYNAEC\nFITNESS\nDE-STRESS\nHEALTH\nASTRO\nMENTAL HEALTH\nSPIRITUALITY\nSTANDSTRONG\nSTART YOUR JOY\nGOOD LIVING\nDECOR\nAPPLIANCES\nTECH\nCELEBS\nINDIAN\nINTERNATIONAL\nCELEB STYLE\nCELEB LOOK\nTRENDING\nACHIEVERS\nIN THE NEWS\n#ACTAGAINSTABUSE\nOPINION\nBEAUTIFUL INDIANS 2023\nFEMINA POWER BRANDS 2022-2023\nFEMINA POWER BRANDS 2021-2022\nFEMINA POWER BRANDS\nLEADING WOMEN IN BUSINESS\nMRS FEMINA\nFEMINA SPARK\nEARTH FEST 2021\nFEMINA RESEARCH\nTRAVEL\nDOMESTIC\nINTERNATIONAL\nMUST SEE\nLIFE\nTV\nMOVIE REVIEWS\nBOOKS\nMUSIC\nCAREERS & MONEY\nKNOWLEDGE & EDUCATION\nMAGAZINE\nSEPTEMBER 2022\nAUGUST 2022\nJULY 2022\nJUNE 2022\nMAY 2022\nAPRIL 2022\nMARCH 2022\nFEBRUARY 2022\nJANUARY 2022\nDECEMBER 2021\nNOVEMBER 2021\nOCTOBER 2021\nSEPTEMBER 2021\nAUGUST 2021\nJULY 2021\nJUNE 2021\nMAY 2021\nAPRIL 2021\nMARCH 2021\nFEBRUARY 2021\nJANUARY 2021\nDECEMBER 2020\nNOVEMBER 2020\nOCTOBER 2020\nSEPTEMBER 2020\nAUGUST 2020\nJULY 2020\nJUNE 2020\nMAY 2020\nAPRIL 2020\nOTHER SITES\nFILMFARE\nTIMES KNOWLEDGE\nGOODHOMES\nGRAZIA\nD/CODE\nPAGEANTS\nPHOTOS\nVIDEOS\nBLOGS\nFILMFARE AWARDS\nFILMFARE AWARDS 2023\nFILMFARE AWARDS 2023 NOMINATIONS\nFILMFARE AWARDS 2023 ALL UPDATES\nFILMFARE AWARDS 2023 WINNERS\nFILMFARE AWARDS 2022\nFILMFARE OTT AWARDS 2022\nSHORT FILMS 2023\nFILMFARE AWARDS MARATHI 2022\nFILMFARE AWARDS BANGLA 2022\nFILMFARE AWARDS SOUTH 2022\nFILMFARE OTT AWARDS 2022 WINNERS\nBEAUTY AWARDS 2022\nYOGA\nFEMINA\nफेमिना हिन्दी\nফেমিনা বাংলা\nதமிழ் ஃபெமினா\nSITEMAP\nABOUT US\nCONTACT US\nPRIVACY POLICY\nTERMS OF USE\nDOWNLOAD\nCopyright © 2023 Worldwide Media | The Times of India.

It’s good for sure but it’s like playing a Russian roulette where the thick patch is the bullet.\nSearch\nSORT BY\nTop reviews\nMost recent\nTop reviews\nFILTER BY\nAll reviewers\nVerified purchase only\nAll reviewers\nAll stars\n5 star only\n4 star only\n3 star only\n2 star only\n1 star only\nPositive reviews\nCritical reviews\nAll stars\nAll formats\nSize: 140 Count (Pack of 1)\nAll formats\nText, image, video\nImage and video reviews only\nText, image, video\n7,291 total ratings, 887 with reviews\nFrom the United States\n\tBrianna Raymond\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Great product!\nReviewed in the United States on October 13, 2023\nSize: 140 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase\nI have been buying mighty patch brand for a few years now and I was hesitant to change to this new TKTK.

They are a constant staple in my skincare routine. They cover up unsightly breakouts while dealing with the problem below the surface (drawing the oil/puss from the breakout and expelling it from your skin). They are easy to apply, can last for over 24 hours on skin, and appear sheer on your skin if you need to wear in public. I typically like to put them on at night after my skincare routine before I go to bed and remove in the morning and will repeat until the breakout is gone. The variety size pack is great so you can tailor to the size of your breakout.

Dermatologists Share the Best 15 Brands of 2023\n\nWith faves from Hero Cosmetics, Peace Out, Clearasil, and more.\n\nby THERESA HOLLAND UPDATED ON 09/13/23 04:02PM\nmedically reviewed by LILY TALAKOUB, MD, FAAD Board-Certified Dermatologist\nfact checked by ANNA HARRIS\nWe independently evaluate all recommended products and services. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn more.\n\nBYRDIE / JACLYN MASTROPASQUA\n\nThere\'s no shortage of over-the-counter products for clearing breakouts. But when you only have one or two zits at any given time, there\'s no need to treat your entire face. Enter the pimple patch, a targeted way to zap acne without exposing the rest of your skin to undue drying or irritation. According to board-certified dermatologist Sheilagh Maguiness, MD, acne patches typically contain hydrocolloid gel,1 which is often used in wound care. Hydrocolloid patches are able to keep the spot moist in order to accelerate healing and protect. In addition to healing blemishes, Dr. Maguiness notes, "The hydrocolloid in the acne sticker can help absorb sebum and dirt."\xa0\n\nClaire Wolinsky, MD, a New York dermatologist specializing in facial rejuvenation, says she loves pimple patches and recommends them frequently: "One reason they are particularly helpful in treating acne is because once covered, patients can\'t pick or squeeze their pimple, which reduces the risk of infection and bacteria." And with less trauma to the skin, Dr. Wolinsky says you\'re less likely to experience scarring or discoloration.\n\nWe conducted hours of research on the best acne patches, evaluating each on active ingredients to target acne as well as ingredients to soothe skin and prevent redness. We also looked at things like how easy they are to apply and how well they stay on. After considering dozens of brands and consulting with two celebrity dermatologists, we landed on the following best in show.\n\n\nOur Top Picks\nBEST OVERALL:\nPeace Out Acne Dots at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST BUDGET:\nSoko Glam The Klog at Sokoglam.com\nJump to Review\nBEST DRUGSTORE:\nClearasil Ultra Overnight Spot Patches at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST SPLURGE:\nPeter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST K-BEAUTY:\nCOSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST FOR DEEP PIMPLES:\nZitSticka Killa Kit at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST FOR SCARRING:\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch The Original at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST MULTI-INGREDIENT:\nAvarelle Acne Cover Patch at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST WITH SALICYLIC ACID:\nDime Beauty Co.

"They employ hydrocolloid2 technology that helps extract impurities and guards against external elements," he explains. What\'s more, the patches create a barrier between pimples and your bacteria-laden fingers while delivering a time-released infusion of ingredients.\n\nCosmetic nurse Kristina Kitsos is also a fan of Peace Out. "They contain salicylic acid,3 which penetrates pores to target acne blemishes and blackheads," she tells Byrdie. Additionally, Kitsos appreciates that these acne patches contain soothing aloe vera to minimize redness and skin-clearing standby vitamin A (aka retinol).4 She says that since they\'re formulated with hydrating ingredients, the skin is able to heal quicker and better than if a drying, alcohol formula was used.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nIf you have skin that dries out or breaks easily, this is a great pick because of the inclusion of aloe vera—which can soothe and hydrate. Even pimple patches can sometimes tear the sensitive skin around a blemish, but you won\'t have to worry about that with these.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $19\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid, salicylic acid, aloe, retinol | Amount: 10 to 40 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\nBest BudgetSoko Glam The Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch\n\nSoko Glam\n\nVIEW ON SOKOGLAM.COM\nWhat We Like\n\nBudget-friendly\n\nLong-lasting adhesive\n\nIncludes two sizes\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nThinner patch than other options\n\nWhile most pimple patches aren\'t very pricey, The Klog\'s Soft Shield is one of the budget-friendliest of the bunch. Containing vegan hydrocolloid,2 the protective yet breathable barrier draws out impurities and helps your zits heal as quickly as possible.\xa0We love that these super-thin patches are almost invisible—perfect for wear during the day. They\'re unnoticeable whether you\'re in a virtual meeting or on a walk, and they\'ll keep your skin shielded from bacteria (and your fingers).\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nThese pimple patches can be super helpful for those who find it hard to stop themselves from picking since they are so lightweight they can be worn anytime. They\'re also great for people on a budget or for those looking for a vegan formula patch.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $6\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 42 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\n\nBest DrugstoreClearasil Ultra Overnight Spot Patches\n\nAmazon\n\nVIEW ON AMAZON\nVIEW ON TARGET\nVIEW ON WALMART\nWhat We Like\n\nBudget-friendly\n\nWorks overnight\n\nNon-drying\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nOnly one size\n\nA few drugstore brands have hopped on the pimple-patch bandwagon, but the best iteration comes from acne-fighting all-star Clearasil. Stick on the Spot Patches before bed, get your beauty sleep, and wake up to noticeable improvements in the size and redness of your blemishes. These patches have thinner, smooth edges, so they\'re able to adhere to the skin better without budging.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nIf you\'re a wild sleeper and often wake up to your pimple patch on your pillow, we recommend these.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $14\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 18 patches | Cruelty-Free: No\n\n\nBest SplurgePeter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots\n\nSephora\n\nVIEW ON AMAZON\nVIEW ON ULTA\nVIEW ON WALMART\nWhat We Like\n\nContains skin-clearing and moisturizing ingredients\n\nIncludes two sizes\n\nComes with tin container\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nDoesn\'t contain hydrocolloid\n\nPeter Thomas Roth\'s take on the acne patch is the super-moisturizing Invisible Dots. In addition to acne-clearing mainstays salicylic acid5 and tea tree oil,6 they call on hyaluronic acid7 to deliver much-needed moisture to the bumps that lie beneath. These aren\'t hydrocolloid patches, so they won\'t absorb the gunk out of a pimple that\'s already come to a head.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nWe recommend these patches for big, red pimples that you want to reduce in size quickly. They can work overnight to greatly shrink blemishes.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $32\n\nActive Ingredients: Salicylic acid, tea tree oil, hyaluronic acid | Amount: 32 patches | Cruelty-Free: No\n\n\n The 13 Best Acne Face Washes of 2023\nBest K-BeautyCOSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch\n\nAmazon\n\nVIEW ON AMAZON\nVIEW ON ULTA\nVIEW ON WALMART\n I Reviewed The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch And Saw Visible Overnight Results\nWhat We Like\n\nMade without irritating ingredients\n\n\nIncludes three sizes\n\n\nDermatologist-recommended\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nMore effective on pimples that have come to a head\n\nDr. Wolinsky is a fan of COSRX Master Patches, and we\'re here for it. Serving up a heaping dose of hydrocolloid8 underneath each hygienic sticker, you can target even the most stubborn bumps with little effort. We also like that these Korean patches come in three different sizes.\n\nWhen we tested them for ourselves, we loved that they didn\'t budge while we slept (even when applied over our nighttime serums). The pimple was noticeably smaller in the morning, and the patches kept the blemish from becoming irritated during use.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nThese patches come in three different sizes to best fit whatever type of pimple you have.

These patches are the ones that you\'ll want to try to get those hard-to-reach blemishes. It has a two-step process: swipe the pad (which is infused with tea tree oil and salicylic acid) on clean skin and then apply the patch directly to the blemish. It\'s made with super-fine microneedles so that the ingredients are able to penetrate the skin better, and the patch is also formulated with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and peptides to hydrate and heal the affected area and effectively flatten the pimple.\n\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nIf you\'ve tried everything for hormonal acne and are looking for a targeted, effective treatment without taking a trip to the dermatologist, these are a great pick. Because of the powerful formula, you should be able to see results overnight.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $18\n\nActive Ingredients: Salicylic acid, tea tree extract, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide | Amount: 6 swabs, 6 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\nBest TransparentRael Miracle Patch Invisible Spot Cover\n\nAmazon\n\nVIEW ON AMAZON\nWhat We Like\n\nVirtually invisible on the skin\n\nGreat value\n\nStays put all day\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nCould come with more sizes\n\nPimple patches are usually clear, but you can still often see the thick material—especially on darker skin tones or under makeup. If you have a blemish that you feel the need to conceal during the day, we recommend reaching for these patches from Rael. They have super thin edges that stick onto the skin seamlessly and lay as flat as possible for a hydrocolloid patch. Even though they\'re less noticeable than others on the market, they\'re still just as effective at protecting from bacteria and removing impurities from the spot overnight.\n\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nPicking at your skin is a hard habit to break, but it\'s necessary in order to not make blemishes worse and create a scar. Wearing a pimple patch throughout the day can help, and these patches from Rael will go unnoticed while you\'re out with friends or even at work.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $17\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 96 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\nWhere We Stand\n\nThe best pimple patches overall are Peace Out Acne Healing Dots. They contain hydrocolloid, and also a blend of soothing and clearing ingredients like retinol, salicylic acid, and aloe. For a more affordable option, consider The Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch, a breathable yet protective solution that draws out impurities and speeds up healing.\n\nWhat to Look for When Buying Acne Patches\nHydrocolloid: "The most important thing is that the stickers or patches are made of hydrocolloid," Dr. Wolinsky tells Byrdie, which is "something dermatologists have used for wound care for a long time." The healing ingredient seals the skin underneath the patch while absorbing fluid, flattening bumps, and minimizing inflammation.8Some options, like Peach Slices Acne Spot Dots, are made with nothing more than hydrocolloid, which does an excellent job taking care of pimples on its own.\nActive Ingredients: Most acne patches utilize hydrocolloid, which can be very effective on its own. However, you\'ll also find options containing a range of other acne-fighting ingredients. As Dr. Wolinsky notes, "Some of these patches have salicylic acid, which may help further treat a nasty breakout." Additionally, you might see soothing aloe vera extract,14 resurfacing retinol,4 complexion-clearing tea tree oil,15 or hydrating hyaluronic acid12 on the ingredients list.\nDime Beauty Power Patches are an excellent choice if you\'re looking for something containing salicylic acid, and Peter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots are a great option with tea tree oil. Some patches, like Mario Badescu Drying Patches, contain both.\nSize: Since pimples and breakouts come in all shapes and sizes, it\'s nice to have a couple of different acne patches to work with. While many brands offer only one size, some packs include two or even three sizes to cover large and small zits accordingly. For instance, The Klog\'s Soft Shield Pimple Patches come with two sizes. You\'ll also find extra-large patches, which are meant to cover multi-bump breakouts.\nFAQ\nHow do acne patches work?\n\n"Most acne patches work by providing a moist occluded environment so that the acne lesion can heal underneath," says Dr. Maguiness. They typically contain hydrocolloid,8 which, as Dr. Wolinsky explains, absorbs the inflammatory fluid, flattens the bump, and speeds up healing. "The added bonus is that they keep fingers off and prevent picking," notes Dr. Maguiness.\n\n\nHow do you apply acne patches?\n\nStarting with freshly washed hands and clean, dry skin, carefully peel the patch off the sheet. Then, gently stick it on the pimple in question, aligning the center of the patch with the center of the pimple. Leave it on for 12 to 24 hours or until it turns opaque.\n\n\nHow often should you use acne patches?\n\nGenerally speaking, you can use acne patches as often as needed. Since they target only a very small portion of your skin, you shouldn\'t have to worry about irritating the rest of your face or neck. In some cases, you might need to use two or three consecutive patches to get rid of a particularly stubborn pimple.\n\n\nWhy Trust Byrdie\n\nTheresa Holland is a skincare devotee and commerce writer specializing in beauty, lifestyle, and wellness.
