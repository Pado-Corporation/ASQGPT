Great product!
Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2023
I have been buying mighty patch brand for a few years now and I was hesitant to change to this new TKTK. Comparing the two in price, I had to give them a try and they work great!! So much more for your money then other brands and still great quality!

Half half
Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023
Sometimes the patch is thicker than my *** but sometimes it’s as thin as my ***. The thick one that I got for the past 2 orders wouldn’t stick to my skin and by the time I woke up in the morning, the patch will be on my hair, my bed sheet, my back and nowhere to be found. It’s good for sure but it’s like playing a Russian roulette where the thick patch is the bullet.

 Just like mighty patch!!
Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2023
Size: 140 Count (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
Such a great value for so much less. I was obsessed with obsessed with the mighty patches put they get really expensive for not a lot especially when you have a lot of pimples. Personally I get really deep painful pimples that last forever these take them away just leashing the little red mark like the patches do. So impressed with this product and the value. Love it so much and could not recommend this more.

My opinion of a product can be clearly measured by if I order it again. It's that simple.
These patches work and dont break my bank. What else is there?

These are so satisfying to use! I wear them to bed and when you wake up you can see white stuff that it pulls out of your pours. Great price, others are more expensive and work the same. Definitely recommend this brand!!

 Variety in sizes

I’ve tried other patches that are popular and this product works the same for a fraction of the price. I also like that it has variety in sizes which is perfect because not all breakouts are made the same

Not as good as the official brands, but better than others at this price point. Sides come up and don’t stick as well, hard to remove from film, but do the job really well.

We put The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch to the test after receiving a complimentary sample from the brand. Keep reading for our full product review. 

Editor’s Note: We reviewed this article on September 24, 2023. As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.

Period, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren't blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month. 

Lucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I'll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.

Keep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.

COSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH

BEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types

KEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid

PRICE: $19

ABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.

About My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts

My skin can be unpredictable. But, as I've gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.  

Ingredients: One key, familiar ingredient 

The tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.

The Feel: Like a bandage

You can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Packaging: Easy to store

The 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish

I placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.

Even with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn't budge overnight.

If you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn't expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn't gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don't believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Value: Worth it

Was this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

Similar Products: You've got options

Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Variety Pack ($7): These 36 count medical-grade, chemical-free, allergy-tested patches stay put no matter how much you toss and turn throughout the night. 

Final Verdict

If you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won't regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.

I swear by these $13 pimple patches for clearing up my acne overnight — I wish I'd had them as a teenager

Hydrocolloid patches absorb pus from pimples, resulting in noticeably smaller and less inflamed blemishes.
I've tried a couple brands of patches, and Mighty Patch has worked better than any of them.
Years after I first discovered the brand, I still buy them for myself all the time. They're a clear and effective overnight fix for acne-prone skin.

From extraction facials and laser treatments to special face washes and oral antibiotics, I've tried many tactics in my decade-old battle with acne. Some, like acne extractions, work very well over the long term, but are quite expensive. Others have dried out my skin or even resulted in more breakouts. The only solution that really works for short-term relief — and that I wish I had tried way earlier — is the hydrocolloid patch. 

Hydrocolloid patches were originally designed for wounds but it turns out they're also perfect for those painful (both physically and emotionally) breakouts that always erupt the night before a big event like an interview or a date.

How hydrocolloid acne patches work

These patches attract water and absorb fluids such as pus so that by the next day, you can literally see everything they've sucked up from your pimples. COSRX was one ofthe first hydrocolloid patch brands, earning rave reviews from other media sites like Buzzfeed and Refinery29 and a 4.6-star rating from 25,000+ Amazon reviews, but I'm a stronger believer in a newer brand's hydrocolloid product: Hero Cosmetics' Mighty Patch, which has a 4.5-star rating and over 90,000 Amazon reviews.

Mighty Patch review

Mighty Patch's Original hydrocolloid patches come in 36- or 72-count packs, and each one measures 12mm across — smaller than a penny. There are also Invisible versions that are thinner and more difficult to see, as well as Surface patches for large clusters of pimples. They work best on pimples with fluid or pus in them, meaning there's a visible whitehead.

After showering and drying my face, I stick the patches directly on the blemishes that fit this description, then let them work their magic. Sometimes, depending on the pimple, I can see and feel results in as quickly as a few hours. Other times, they take longer to take effect, and I sleep with them overnight.

Hero Cosmetics

The results are somewhat gross, but oddly satisfying: The sticker turns white with the pus it has absorbed.

The difference after applying a sticker is clear, and not only visually. Each time, my pimples dramatically reduced in both size and pain. I'm always amazed at how well they work. Over the last couple of years, I've become very comfortable with slapping them all over my face every night, and even during the daytime when I go to work.

Cons of Mighty Patch

The main drawback of these patches is that they can be noticeable if you wear them (the Original product) in public. As a solution, the company made Invisible patches (find our review here), which are more subtle and harder to notice. 

If you're new to pimple patches, you may also find it difficult to peel them off the sheet without wrinkling or folding them, but Hero Cosmetics tries to combat this with an easy-peel sheet design that tears the entire sheet into thirds.

Unexpected benefits of Mighty Patch

A side benefit of these hydrocolloid patches is that they prevent bored, wandering fingers from touching and picking pimples. Every person who has acne hears over and over again and knows from personal experience that picking leads to irritation and scarring, but it's much easier said than done not to do it. As the patches work to minimize your blemish, they also protect the affected area from exposure to unclean pillows and hands. 

Mighty Patch versus COSRX and other competitors 

I also bought myself the COSRX patches to compare their performance, and considering their high reviews and cult status, I was surprised to find they were much less effective than Mighty Patch. The COSRX hydrocolloid patches come in multiple sizes, and they're cheaper than Mighty Patch. However, they were prone to falling off my face as I slept, and rarely absorbed as much fluid as the Mighty Patch stickers. 

In addition to COSRX, I've tried many other patches like the cute (but ultimately ineffective) Starface Hydro-Stars and No B.S. Healing Acne Patches, but again and again, they didn't stack up to Mighty Patch.

While Mighty Patch may be more expensive, I'd much rather opt for the product that actually works. The company originally sent me free samples for review back in April 2018, but since then, I've regularly bought them myself and they've become an integral part of my skin-care kit.

The bottom line

Having dealt with acne since I was a teen, I regret not trying these gentle, non-invasive, and non-drying hydrocolloid patches earlier, but I'm now a serious proponent of using them for banishing acne. They're easy to slip into your bag to take on the go, and as simple stickers, they're low maintenance. 

I'm stocking up on the ones from Mighty Patch in particular because they've shown time after time that they're the best on the market.

Leaves marks on my skin
Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2023
I’m not sure if this product has changed or something, but the last package that I ordered leaves marks on my skin where the patch was :( i have fairly sensitive skin and it’s hard to find patches that work for me. With how expensive these are, it’s definitely not worth it in my opinion.
Other notes: they stay on pretty well (stable), and the absorbency is comparable to other brands. They do not come in different sizes, and the patch is on the bigger size compared to the sizes that other brands offer. The plastic sheet has little tears that let you peel the sticker off without folding it.

These work if you have a few large pimples or spots. I would put them on at night, and by morning the pimples were much smaller. I did have to use them several nights in a row though, or the pimple would just keep regenerating. So it's like it wasn't visible on top of the skin, but it was still there under the skin.

 Acne patch
Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2022
Style Name: 24ctVerified Purchase
So I've never used an acne patch before but I had a large stubborn pimple that wouldn't go away so I decided to try these. The packaging was fine and it arrived quickly. I did notice a few reviews saying it didn't help their cystic acne, but it states on the box that it is not for that so you can't blame neutrogena.

I cleaned the area with toner after my shower and placed one on the large pimple and one on a painful smaller one I could feel coming in. I slept with them on no problem, I forgot they were there. It does show a picture on the box the size of the blemish its designed for this is in one of the pictures, so the larger one I had exceeded the recommended size. When I woke up the next morning I used my fingernail to grasp an edge and pulled level towards my ear rather then straight away from the face, the box does give directions. When I looked the larger one was slightly smaller and the other one was almost gone except for a small red dot as you can see the smaller one in the collage of pictures (the top is before and the bottom is after).

I did read reviews stating it helps to pop it before placing the patch but I didn't need to do this. I personally would not wear these out of the house as they are noticeable even on my light skin tone. I don't wear makeup so I can't say if that would help. I can say the redness and swelling were brought down a lot over night for the smaller one I had, but not much happened on the other. The last picture is of the patch itself so you get an idea of the size. It stuck no problem over night and was easy to remove. Bottom line I would buy again for smaller blemishes.

Editor’s Note: We reviewed this article on September 24, 2023. As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.

Period, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren't blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month. 

Lucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I'll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.

Keep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.

COSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH

BEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types

KEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid

PRICE: $19

ABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.

About My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts

My skin can be unpredictable. But, as I've gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.  

Ingredients: One key, familiar ingredient 

The tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.

The Feel: Like a bandage

You can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Packaging: Easy to store

The 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish

I placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.

Even with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn't budge overnight.

If you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn't expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn't gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don't believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Value: Worth it

Was this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

Similar Products: You've got options 

squish. Flower Power Acne Patches ($14): This pack of 20 floral hydrocolloid pimple patches to help zap blemishes overnight and let's face it, they're pretty darn cute. Pimple, but make them pretty. 

Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Variety Pack ($7): These 36 count medical-grade, chemical-free, allergy-tested patches stay put no matter how much you toss and turn throughout the night. 

Final Verdict

If you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won't regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.

HOMEGUIDEYOUR PERFECT PIMPLE PATCH
Your Perfect Pimple Patch
by ALI OSHINSKY

Ever since I stuck a cut-up Band-Aid on my face in the hopes of healing a particularly uncomfortable whitehead, I’ve been convinced that all hydrocolloid patches [i.e. pimple patches] are pretty much the same. When I emailed cosmetic chemist Victoria Fu on the subject, she confirmed my suspicion. “Hydrocolloid dressings have been around for a while,” Victoria explains, “and they’re all generally made in the same way.” Basically, there’s a special congealing liquid that’s combined with adhesive, and the mixture is applied to a plastic sheet. Sometimes, Victoria notes, acne-fighting ingredients are added to the adhesive-hydrocolloid mixture, but this doesn’t exactly do much. “You’re better off applying your regular acne treatments before applying the dressing,” says Victoria.

Thickness is another thing that doesn’t really matter—thick or thin patches shrink pimples at the same rate. In fact, the only variable you need to keep in mind is how well the patch sticks to your skin . “With good adherence,” Victoria explains, “a hydrocolloid can create an enclosed, moist, protected environment for hours and even days.”

You won't find any patches with attachment issues below. And then I further refined the list, based on price, size, and translucence. Some are more matte than others for invisible daily wear, some are big, some are tiny, some have funky shapes and colors. But enough of that, your perfect pack awaits.

The Cheapest: Peach Slices + Alba Botanica

Unlike sometimes pricey spot treatments, pimple patches don’t need to be expensive to work. Both Peach Slices and Alba Botanica’s versions net out to under $.20 per patch (15 and 18 respectively). And while Peach Slices is definitely the cheapest, Alba’s is more matte—perfect for daytime use. Plus, both are easy to buy IRL in a pinch—Peach Slices is sold at CVS, while Alba is at Target.

The Most Invisible: Rael

It doesn’t matter what a patch looks like when you’re wearing it to bed. When you want to wear it to work, it’s a different story—shiny patches stand out from skin or makeup, but matte ones go more or less undetected. These Rael patches have a slightly thinner outer edge to blend into skin, and the plastic laminate has a powdery, matte finish that’s not too conspicuous. It’s the best choice options for keeping your zit protected and treated during work hours.

The Cleanest Application: Avarelle

A big part of making sure your patch adheres well is how you apply it. Some patches, when you try to seperate them from their plastic backing, ball up on the side and create a bump that doesn’t lay flat. These Avarelle patches are packaged on a clear, perforated plastic sheet that you can fold and peel off while keeping the patch itself intact. It comes in classic, AM and PM versions (the AM versions are smaller and less obvious, and they’re infused with different anti-acne ingredients), but since the additives don’t make much of a difference, you can pick at random—I like the classic version for no reason in particular. All three variations come with the same great backing.

The One For Cysts: ZitSticka Killa Patches

Not a hydrocolloid, ZitSticka’s patches consist of a plastic cover, an adhesive ring, and a pad of salicylic acid and niacinamide microdarts meant to penetrate the epidermis and reach deep into those painful, under-the-skin pimples. Other pimple patch brands make cystic acne-fighting patches with microdarts, but ZitSticka’s are the sturdiest and feel the most comfortable on skin. The darts are the biggest, but the patch itself is slim and adheres well. They’re also the least conspicuous of the microdart patches, if you’re into wearing them out. ZitSticka’s patches are also the most expensive on this list, and come in pretty silly packaging—half of the pack is individually wrapped Killa patches, and the other half is filled with cleaning pads, which I’d recommend you skip. (Rubbing alcohol on cystic pimples only dries out the top layer of skin and traps the infection down there for longer.) Still, if you’ve tried everything you can for cysts and still can’t get relief, these are worth a try—not only do they reduce the size of the cyst, but they also prevent you from picking and making it worse.

The Best XL: Hero Mighty Patch Surface

Out of all the large acne patches I tried, the Mighty Patch Surfaces were by far the best—large enough to cover a couple close-together back zits, and sturdy enough to stay put through a shower and outfit changes. They also do a great job of being invisible, despite the large size. But that being said, if you don’t care about it blending in, Band-Aid Hydro Seal Blister Heels are of comparable size and sturdiness, and one pack costs a third as much at the drugstore.

The Cute One: Starface

The one to wear when you don’t want your coworkers staring at your face thinking, ‘Is that a pimple patch?’ They're star-shaped and yellow and quite conspicuous, but that’s the point! They're very cute. Recently, I’ve been relying on these the most for daytime—and now when a zit pops up on my cheek, I actually get excited about it. Is that weird? A bonus perk is that it’s nearly impossible to lose the little yellow pod they come in, a problem I’ve noticed with the slim sheets of other packages. Peel it off gently to avoid wrinkling any of the star points.

Reviewed: I Tried the Killa Cystic Acne Patches and OMG

I could genuinely cry right now?

BY ELIZABETH DENTONPUBLISHED: FEB 22, 2019
SAVE ARTICLE
Courtesy/Katie Buckleitner

When I was a teenager, I was one of the lucky few who made it through high school without any acne, so I kind of thought I’d be safe forever. But now that I’m in my early 30s (33 is still considered early, right?), my jaw has become a minefield of hormonal, cystic pimples that flare up at the first sign of PMS. Yay.


This content is imported from poll. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.

You wouldn’t know it by looking at me, though, because my zits so rarely come to a head—they just live deep inside, haunting me, so painful and hot that I sit there dreaming about cutting them out (dark, but true). Which is why I was stoked to hear about ZitSticka, a new acne patch specifically designed to treat below-the-surface pimples before they take over your face. And, to see if they were really worth the hype, I tested them out in the name of science clear skin.

THE PATCH DEETS

More From Cosmopolitan
 

“But I’m already obsessed with acne patches!” you cry. And, hey, same. But these are different than the hydrocolloid bandages you’ve been using from, say, Peach & Lily or CosRx. Because unlike traditional patches, which only work on zits that have already “popped” (so they can absorb fluid from the pimple), ZitSticka’s patches treat unpopped, underground zits using itty-bitty, medication-filled micro-darts. Stay with me, here.

Guess How Often You Should Wash Your Hair?

The patch—aptly named Killa—looks like a regular hydrocolloid bandage, but with one key difference: Its sticky surface is covered with 24 dissolvable micro-darts that gently penetrate the stratum corneum and epidermis (your top two layers of skin) to push medication into your pimple. Each dart is filled with acne-fighting and skin-healing ingredients, including hyaluronic acid (to moisturize), niacinamide (to calm inflammation), salicylic acid (to loosen and break down the pimple), and oligopeptide-76 (to kill bacteria).

Each Killa Kit contains eight individually packaged patches and eight pre-treat wipes (soaked with salicylic acid, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and alcohol to sanitize skin and add an extra acne-killing punch before you slap on the patch). Just dab the pimple with a wipe, let it dry for a few seconds, then stick on the patch and live your life.

See the tiny micro-darts on the sticky side of the patch?

WTF IT FELT LIKE

If you’ve used hydrocolloid patches before, you know there’s nothing more satisfying than seeing it turn white from a pimple’s gunk. It’s one of the gross-but-amazing parts of skincare. Sadly, you’re not going to get that with Killa; the darts aren’t actually permeating the zit’s core (it’s impossible to pop cystic pimples from the surface), so they won’t really draw out any gunk overnight.

Still, I was surprised by how incredibly satisfying the patch felt when I applied it—like I was doing something productive for my pimple. After washing my face and wiping down my most painful cystic zit, I pressed on the Killa patch, holding it for 15 seconds, as recommended, to help it really adhere. The darts actually do feel prickly when you first press on the patch—kind of like a piece of velcro against your skin—but the whole thing is more uncomfortable than it is painful. The brand recommends leaving the patch on for at least two hours to allow the darts to fully dissolve, but I decided to apply it right before bed to give it a full seven hours to work.

THE RESULTS

Part of me didn’t expect this patch to work at all (I’ve seen too many gimmicks), but by the time I woke up and peeled it off, my zit was noticeably calmer. The warmth and redness that had been radiating from it the night before were diminished—it was now just a pink, barely painful bump. In fact, within 48 hours, the zit had cleared up completely, as if I had gotten a cortisone injection from my derm.

I was legitimately shocked these patches worked so well, so I went to experts to find out, well, why. Was I just a lucky case? According to dermatologist Mona Gohara, MD, associate clinical professor at Yale University (and not affiliated with ZitSticka), the niacinamide (vitamin B3) in each micro-dart was the “magic ingredient” for my cyst. “Niacinamide is a potent anti-inflammatory that’s sometimes prescribed as an oral medication because it’s so effective,” she says, noting that it becomes even more powerful when combined with hyaluronic acid, which “pushes in moisture to reduce irritation.” Basically, she’s not surprised Killa worked so well for me.

WILL IT WORK FOR YOU?

Here’s the thing about Killa: It’s not an acne cure. Though the micro-darts are effective at penetrating the first two layers of skin, Dr. Gohara says the ingredients seem less effective at treating and healing pimples, and more effective at reducing the inflammation within a pimple—which, in turn, can help your body heal it faster on its own.

So what does all this mean for you? Killa patches won’t replace your skincare routine—you’ll still need a good cleanser and zit-fighting regimen—nor should they, considering a box of eight patches and wipes retails for $29, which, if you’re using them daily, will add up fast. Still, when you’ve got the occasional underground zit and don’t have the time (or money) to run to the derm for an injection, you can use these patches to help reduce the redness and swelling of a pimple fast. And that, as far as I’m concerned, is worth all of the micro-darts and money in the world.

I have bought many many different pimple patches in the last few years, and I find that these are one of the best values for your money. They work as well as any other brand, but the adhesion is a little less adhesive than others. Not so much that it’s an issue, but they could afford to be a little bit stickier. I recommend these over the expensive ones that barely give you any patches, don't fall for those, get these instead. They help tremendously with my breakouts, which I get often.

 THE BEST ACNE PATCH THERE IS!
Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2019
Pattern Name: Acne PatchesVerified Purchase
I found these acne patches after trying quite a few different brands. There were many issues with the others I've tried: patches didn't stay on well, they didn't absorb the funky stuff from the acne, they left a mark, and / or were way too obvious. These SAKURA ACNE PATCHES are the opposite of all that- THEY ARE AMAZING! They stay in place until they are filled up with the junk they've absorbed. They stick so well that I can wash my face with it on so I don't spread acne germs to other parts of my face. The acne is noticeably improved after wearing the patch for even just a couple (2) hours; the blemish is lighter in color, not as swollen, and not as raised! Once the patch fills up, I remove it and apply another. I repeat the process until the blemish is gone. For me, it takes about 2-3 days from start to finish. I am so thankful to have found these patches. They help clear things up quickly and painlessly, which in turn helps me feel more confident about my skin. I've purchased these patches 3 times now and will continue to do so when I am in need. I highly recommend them! PS- SAKURA, please make some sort of face mask with the qualities and powers of these patches! I can only imagine the wonders it would do for the entire face!

I order these across Amazon from quite a few brands, and these hold up just fine. These absorb oil from my skin and help reduce pimples in a healthy manner as advertised. I prefer these compared to the versions with tea tree oil. I find that the ones without the oil help skin heal faster if there have been any breaks. I will continue to purchase this brand as necessary.

These are great! Mid-30s mom here who has suffered with chest and back acne once a month since my teens, and these knock it out overnight (most of the time)! I like that they’re fairly inconspicuous, especially on my chest/back so I’m not as self conscious.
After a shower, I just clean the area with a cotton swab and alcohol, dry, then apply and leave on until it easily comes off (usually about 24 hours later/after another shower). 9 times out of 10, that’s all it takes and the spot is gone. Ocassionally, I have to reapply again but it’s never taken more than 2 applications.
Highly recommend, these are now a staple in my house.

Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2021
Pattern Name: Acne PatchesVerified Purchase
I was always so skeptical about trends like these. I’ve suffered with acne for decades and damn — these things work. I’m horrible at skin care and I’ll touch pop squeeze everything I’m not supposed to. I should know by now that those methods will just prolong everything but I just can’t help It and want it gone now! Let me tell you these things work. As soon as I feel some type of bump, I’ll put one on and the magic works and it’ll pull everything out and I swear by day two it looks so much better compared to day two without it. The best part is as often as I use these things and for the amount of bumps I get, I still have so many patches left. You definitely get your money’s worth AND then some. I definitely recommend and I’m definitely purchasing more — especially if they’re on the [lightning]deal of the day.

Sometimes the patch is thicker than my *** but sometimes it’s as thin as my ***. The thick one that I got for the past 2 orders wouldn’t stick to my skin and by the time I woke up in the morning, the patch will be on my hair, my bed sheet, my back and nowhere to be found. It’s good for sure but it’s like playing a Russian roulette where the thick patch is the bullet.

Such a great value for so much less. I was obsessed with obsessed with the mighty patches put they get really expensive for not a lot especially when you have a lot of pimples. Personally I get really deep painful pimples that last forever these take them away just leashing the little red mark like the patches do. So impressed with this product and the value. Love it so much and could not recommend this more.

The packaging was fine and it arrived quickly. I did notice a few reviews saying it didn\'t help their cystic acne, but it states on the box that it is not for that so you can\'t blame neutrogena.\n\nI cleaned the area with toner after my shower and placed one on the large pimple and one on a painful smaller one I could feel coming in. I slept with them on no problem, I forgot they were there. It does show a picture on the box the size of the blemish its designed for this is in one of the pictures, so the larger one I had exceeded the recommended size. When I woke up the next morning I used my fingernail to grasp an edge and pulled level towards my ear rather then straight away from the face, the box does give directions. When I looked the larger one was slightly smaller and the other one was almost gone except for a small red dot as you can see the smaller one in the collage of pictures (the top is before and the bottom is after).\n\nI did read reviews stating it helps to pop it before placing the patch but I didn\'t need to do this. I personally would not wear these out of the house as they are noticeable even on my light skin tone. I don\'t wear makeup so I can\'t say if that would help. I can say the redness and swelling were brought down a lot over night for the smaller one I had, but not much happened on the other. The last picture is of the patch itself so you get an idea of the size. It stuck no problem over night and was easy to remove. Bottom line I would buy again for smaller blemishes.\n30 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nPrevious page\nNext page\nQuestions?

But now that I’m in my early 30s (33 is still considered early, right?), my jaw has become a minefield of hormonal, cystic pimples that flare up at the first sign of PMS. Yay.\n\n\nThis content is imported from poll. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nYou wouldn’t know it by looking at me, though, because my zits so rarely come to a head—they just live deep inside, haunting me, so painful and hot that I sit there dreaming about cutting them out (dark, but true). Which is why I was stoked to hear about ZitSticka, a new acne patch specifically designed to treat below-the-surface pimples before they take over your face. And, to see if they were really worth the hype, I tested them out in the name of science clear skin.\n\nZitSticka Killa Kit\n$29 AT ZITSTICKA.COM\nCredit: Courtesy Image\n\nTHE PATCH DEETS\n\nMore From Cosmopolitan\n\xa0\n\n“But I’m already obsessed with acne patches!” you cry. And, hey, same. But these are different than the hydrocolloid bandages you’ve been using from, say, Peach & Lily or CosRx. Because unlike traditional patches, which only work on zits that have already “popped” (so they can absorb fluid from the pimple), ZitSticka’s patches treat unpopped, underground zits using itty-bitty, medication-filled micro-darts. Stay with me, here.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nRelated Stories\nHow to Easily Get (or Fake) Thicker Brows\nI Tried That Viral Boob Mask From Instagram\nGuess How Often You Should Wash Your Hair?\n\nThe patch—aptly named Killa—looks like a regular hydrocolloid bandage, but with one key difference: Its sticky surface is covered with 24 dissolvable micro-darts that gently penetrate the stratum corneum and epidermis (your top two layers of skin) to push medication into your pimple. Each dart is filled with acne-fighting and skin-healing ingredients, including hyaluronic acid (to moisturize), niacinamide (to calm inflammation), salicylic acid (to loosen and break down the pimple), and oligopeptide-76 (to kill bacteria).\n\nEach Killa Kit contains eight individually packaged patches and eight pre-treat wipes (soaked with salicylic acid, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and alcohol to sanitize skin and add an extra acne-killing punch before you slap on the patch). Just dab the pimple with a wipe, let it dry for a few seconds, then stick on the patch and live your life.\n\nSee the tiny micro-darts on the sticky side of the patch?\nCourtesy Image\n\nWTF IT FELT LIKE\n\nIf you’ve used hydrocolloid patches before, you know there’s nothing more satisfying than seeing it turn white from a pimple’s gunk. It’s one of the gross-but-amazing parts of skincare. Sadly, you’re not going to get that with Killa; the darts aren’t actually permeating the zit’s core (it’s impossible to pop cystic pimples from the surface), so they won’t really draw out any gunk overnight.\n\nStill, I was surprised by how incredibly satisfying the patch felt when I applied it—like I was doing something productive for my pimple. After washing my face and wiping down my most painful cystic zit, I pressed on the Killa patch, holding it for 15 seconds, as recommended, to help it really adhere. The darts actually do feel prickly when you first press on the patch—kind of like a piece of velcro against your skin—but the whole thing is more uncomfortable than it is painful. The brand recommends leaving the patch on for at least two hours to allow the darts to fully dissolve, but I decided to apply it right before bed to give it a full seven hours to work.\n\nTHE RESULTS\n\nPart of me didn’t expect this patch to work at all (I’ve seen too many gimmicks), but by the time I woke up and peeled it off, my zit was noticeably calmer. The warmth and redness that had been radiating from it the night before were diminished—it was now just a pink, barely painful bump. In fact, within 48 hours, the zit had cleared up completely, as if I had gotten a cortisone injection from my derm.\n\nMy underground zit before the sticker (left), and immediately after (right) I removed the sticker the following morning.\nElizabeth Denton\n\nI was legitimately shocked these patches worked so well, so I went to experts to find out, well, why. Was I just a lucky case? According to dermatologist Mona Gohara, MD, associate clinical professor at Yale University (and not affiliated with ZitSticka), the niacinamide (vitamin B3) in each micro-dart was the “magic ingredient” for my cyst. “Niacinamide is a potent anti-inflammatory that’s sometimes prescribed as an oral medication because it’s so effective,” she says, noting that it becomes even more powerful when combined with hyaluronic acid, which “pushes in moisture to reduce irritation.” Basically, she’s not surprised Killa worked so well for me.\n\nCourtesy\n\nWILL IT WORK FOR YOU?\n\nHere’s the thing about Killa: It’s not an acne cure. Though the micro-darts are effective at penetrating the first two layers of skin, Dr. Gohara says the ingredients seem less effective at treating and healing pimples, and more effective at reducing the inflammation within a pimple—which, in turn, can help your body heal it faster on its own.\n\nSo what does all this mean for you? Killa patches won’t replace your skincare routine—you’ll still need a good cleanser and zit-fighting regimen—nor should they, considering a box of eight patches and wipes retails for $29, which, if you’re using them daily, will add up fast. Still, when you’ve got the occasional underground zit and don’t have the time (or money) to run to the derm for an injection, you can use these patches to help reduce the redness and swelling of a pimple fast. And that, as far as I’m concerned, is worth all of the micro-darts and money in the world.\n\nThis content is imported from poll.

When I emailed cosmetic chemist Victoria Fu on the subject, she confirmed my suspicion. “Hydrocolloid dressings have been around for a while,” Victoria explains, “and they’re all generally made in the same way.” Basically, there’s a special congealing liquid that’s combined with adhesive, and the mixture is applied to a plastic sheet. Sometimes, Victoria notes, acne-fighting ingredients are added to the adhesive-hydrocolloid mixture, but this doesn’t exactly do much. “You’re better off applying your regular acne treatments before applying the dressing,” says Victoria.\n\nThickness is another thing that doesn’t really matter—thick or thin patches shrink pimples at the same rate. In fact, the only variable you need to keep in mind is how well the patch sticks to your skin . “With good adherence,” Victoria explains, “a hydrocolloid can create an enclosed, moist, protected environment for hours and even days.”\n\nYou won\'t find any patches with attachment issues below. And then I further refined the list, based on price, size, and translucence. Some are more matte than others for invisible daily wear, some are big, some are tiny, some have funky shapes and colors. But enough of that, your perfect pack awaits.\n\nThe Cheapest: Peach Slices + Alba Botanica\n\nUnlike sometimes pricey spot treatments, pimple patches don’t need to be expensive to work. Both Peach Slices and Alba Botanica’s versions net out to under $.20 per patch (15 and 18 respectively). And while Peach Slices is definitely the cheapest, Alba’s is more matte—perfect for daytime use. Plus, both are easy to buy IRL in a pinch—Peach Slices is sold at CVS, while Alba is at Target.\n\nThe Most Invisible: Rael\n\nIt doesn’t matter what a patch looks like when you’re wearing it to bed. When you want to wear it to work, it’s a different story—shiny patches stand out from skin or makeup, but matte ones go more or less undetected. These Rael patches have a slightly thinner outer edge to blend into skin, and the plastic laminate has a powdery, matte finish that’s not too conspicuous. It’s the best choice options for keeping your zit protected and treated during work hours.\n\nThe Cleanest Application: Avarelle\n\nA big part of making sure your patch adheres well is how you apply it. Some patches, when you try to seperate them from their plastic backing, ball up on the side and create a bump that doesn’t lay flat. These Avarelle patches are packaged on a clear, perforated plastic sheet that you can fold and peel off while keeping the patch itself intact. It comes in classic, AM and PM versions (the AM versions are smaller and less obvious, and they’re infused with different anti-acne ingredients), but since the additives don’t make much of a difference, you can pick at random—I like the classic version for no reason in particular. All three variations come with the same great backing.\n\nThe One For Cysts: ZitSticka Killa Patches\n\nNot a hydrocolloid, ZitSticka’s patches consist of a plastic cover, an adhesive ring, and a pad of salicylic acid and niacinamide microdarts meant to penetrate the epidermis and reach deep into those painful, under-the-skin pimples. Other pimple patch brands make cystic acne-fighting patches with microdarts, but ZitSticka’s are the sturdiest and feel the most comfortable on skin. The darts are the biggest, but the patch itself is slim and adheres well. They’re also the least conspicuous of the microdart patches, if you’re into wearing them out. ZitSticka’s patches are also the most expensive on this list, and come in pretty silly packaging—half of the pack is individually wrapped Killa patches, and the other half is filled with cleaning pads, which I’d recommend you skip. (Rubbing alcohol on cystic pimples only dries out the top layer of skin and traps the infection down there for longer.) Still, if you’ve tried everything you can for cysts and still can’t get relief, these are worth a try—not only do they reduce the size of the cyst, but they also prevent you from picking and making it worse.\n\nThe Best XL: Hero Mighty Patch Surface\n\nOut of all the large acne patches I tried, the Mighty Patch Surfaces were by far the best—large enough to cover a couple close-together back zits, and sturdy enough to stay put through a shower and outfit changes. They also do a great job of being invisible, despite the large size. But that being said, if you don’t care about it blending in, Band-Aid Hydro Seal Blister Heels are of comparable size and sturdiness, and one pack costs a third as much at the drugstore.\n\nThe Cute One: Starface\n\nThe one to wear when you don’t want your coworkers staring at your face thinking, ‘Is that a pimple patch?’ They\'re star-shaped and yellow and quite conspicuous, but that’s the point! They\'re very cute. Recently, I’ve been relying on these the most for daytime—and now when a zit pops up on my cheek, I actually get excited about it. Is that weird? A bonus perk is that it’s nearly impossible to lose the little yellow pod they come in, a problem I’ve noticed with the slim sheets of other packages. Peel it off gently to avoid wrinkling any of the star points.\n\n—Ali Oshinsky\n\nPhoto via ITG\n\nSHARETWEETPINCOPY\nMore:\nACNE\nSKINCARE\nWEIRD SKINCARE\nEVERYTHING ACNE\nDON\'T MISSMost Popular\nTHE EXTRAS\nHow To Be A Person Who Has Their Life Together\nOPEN THREAD\nWhat\'s Everyone Reading?\nTHE REVIEW\nFor Every Top Shelf, There’s a Bottom Shelf\nGUIDE\nHow Not To Mess Up Your At-Home Hair Color\nTHE EXTRAS\nThe Makeup Bags Of Glossier HQ: Extreme Makeover Edition\nGUIDE\nFind Your Tinted Moisturizer Soulmate\nSign up for email updates (including Into The Gloss stories and event invites, plus Glossier launches and product info).

There were many issues with the others I\'ve tried: patches didn\'t stay on well, they didn\'t absorb the funky stuff from the acne, they left a mark, and / or were way too obvious. These SAKURA ACNE PATCHES are the opposite of all that- THEY ARE AMAZING! They stay in place until they are filled up with the junk they\'ve absorbed. They stick so well that I can wash my face with it on so I don\'t spread acne germs to other parts of my face. The acne is noticeably improved after wearing the patch for even just a couple (2) hours; the blemish is lighter in color, not as swollen, and not as raised! Once the patch fills up, I remove it and apply another. I repeat the process until the blemish is gone. For me, it takes about 2-3 days from start to finish. I am so thankful to have found these patches. They help clear things up quickly and painlessly, which in turn helps me feel more confident about my skin. I\'ve purchased these patches 3 times now and will continue to do so when I am in need. I highly recommend them! PS- SAKURA, please make some sort of face mask with the qualities and powers of these patches! I can only imagine the wonders it would do for the entire face!\n11 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tLisa\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Do the job\nReviewed in the United States on November 18, 2022\nPattern Name: Acne PatchesVerified Purchase\nI order these across Amazon from quite a few brands, and these hold up just fine.

Mid-30s mom here who has suffered with chest and back acne once a month since my teens, and these knock it out overnight (most of the time)! I like that they’re fairly inconspicuous, especially on my chest/back so I’m not as self conscious.\nAfter a shower, I just clean the area with a cotton swab and alcohol, dry, then apply and leave on until it easily comes off (usually about 24 hours later/after another shower). 9 times out of 10, that’s all it takes and the spot is gone. Ocassionally, I have to reapply again but it’s never taken more than 2 applications.\nHighly recommend, these are now a staple in my house.\nOne person found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tlynisbored\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Definitely would buy again!\nReviewed in the United States on March 18, 2021\nPattern Name: Acne PatchesVerified Purchase\nI was always so skeptical about trends like these.

As soon as I feel some type of bump, I’ll put one on and the magic works and it’ll pull everything out and I swear by day two it looks so much better compared to day two without it. The best part is as often as I use these things and for the amount of bumps I get, I still have so many patches left. You definitely get your money’s worth AND then some.

The Best Patch for Every Kind of Pimple
By Rio Viera-Newton, a beauty columnist at the Strategist and author of Let's Face It.

When it comes to preventing future breakouts, ingredients like tretinoin, benzoyl peroxide, and azelaic acid are your dermatologist-approved best bet. But as far as treating active acne goes, in my humble opinion, there are few products as efficacious and quite frankly satisfying as the glorious pimple patch.

Generally, pimple patches are circular, hydrocolloid, Band-Aid-esque spot treatments that work by absorbing drainage (such as pus and the clear liquid that sometimes oozes out) from your zit while simultaneously covering the area to protect the inflamed skin. When in doubt, slap a pimple patch on the breakout and you’ll most likely wake to a flatter, smaller, and all-around less angry pimple.

When I first got into skin care, there were only a handful of pimple patches on the market. But these days, there are endless options in various sizes and formulas. Below, a list of my favorite pimple patches along with when and where to use them.

For standard whiteheads
COSRX Pimple Master Patch Set - 90 Count
$15 for 96

If you wake up with a standard whitehead, apply your standard, 100 percent hydrocolloid pimple patch. This simple patch will help draw the pus from the blemish so that by the time you remove it, the area will be much flatter and less noticeable.

For deep, mean cystic pimples
Acropass Trouble Cure
$18

Let’s say you have one of those deep, under-the-skin, painful pimples that simply won’t go away. In this instance, a standard pimple patch likely won’t do much — sure, it might be able to protect the area and prevent you from picking, but with a super-under-the-skin spot, a standard pimple patch isn’t going to penetrate or absorb anything. For these meanies, micro darts are your best bet for effectively delivering treatment in to the blemish and shrinking it down.

These patches from Acropass are a two-step system: First, you wipe the area with a pad drenched in anti-inflammatory and antibacterial salicylic acid and tea-tree oil to help treat the pimple on the surface. Then apply the pimple patch itself. But this is no standard pimple patch: It’s coated in teeny-tiny crystal micro-darts made up of hyaluronic acid and niacinamide that treat the cyst.

This product is quite polarizing: It works wonders for some and doesn’t do much for others. But from my own experience, I can say this has helped me out with my angriest, deepest cystic pimples.

For “I dont know what this bump is” pimples
PURITO All Care Recovery Cica-Aid Patches - 51 Count
$9

It happens to the best of us: You look in the mirror and come across a zit, but you don’t exactly know what kind of zit it is. It doesn’t have a whitehead, but it’s not quite big enough to be a full-on cyst (plus, you don’t want to waste one of your precious Acropass patches on it because they’re not cheap!) In these instances, Purito’s All Care Recovery Cica-Aid is an excellent choice. The hydrocolloid patch is infused with centella asiatica, an ultrasoothing ingredient that helps reduce swelling and redness. It won’t irritate the area, and whatever the zit might be, the centella’s calming benefits are bound to help.

For cute coverage of standard pimples
Squish Flower Power Acne Patches
$14
BUY AT AMAZON
$14 AT NORDSTROM
Starface Hydro-Stars Party Pack - Big Pack, 96 Count
$27
BUY AT AMAZON

Adorable options are, in my opinion, one of the greatest innovations in the pimple patch space. Beloved by many celebrities — Justin and Hailey Bieber as well as Dua Lipa are just a few that have sported them outside the house — these cute little sticker-esque patches are darling enough to wear all day so you can treat and protect your pimples on the go. These are also particularly great for people who have picking tendencies. With these on all day, you can curb your urge to poke and prod.

For pimple clusters and larger areas
Rael Beauty Miracle Acne Patch Spot Control Cover - 10 Count
$12
$13 now 8% off

If you’re dealing with multiple pimples in one area — this sometimes happens to me along my chin or jawline — these large hydrocolloid strips are super-handy. They’re flexible, adhere to the skin really well, and allow you to treat the whole area without having to use tons of your standard patches.

$12 AT AMAZON
$12 AT NORDSTROM
For post-pimple scarring
ZitSticka Hyperfade Dark Spot Microdart Patch - 12 Count
$34 for 12

Another micro-dart pimple patch — but it’s specifically formulated for post-acne scarring rather than active spots. These self-dissolving micro-darts are formulated with a powerful brightening cocktail of arbutin, tranexamic acid, kojic acid, vitamin C, and niacinamide, all of which work together to help eradicate darkness left behind by pimples by delivering the formula directly into the affected area. Seeing as these micro darts are the most potent of all the pimple patches, you might get some redness if you’re on the sensitive side and should proceed with caution. However, if you know your skin can tolerate these ingredients, it’s a great way to spot treat stubborn dark marks that just won’t fade on their own.

The best blemish patches out there
Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2023
I have tried all types of blemish patches, everything from thin and sheer to rainbow clouds and stars designs, but I will never stray from these. These COSRX blemish patches give you a good assortment of sizes, and they are virtually invisible once put on, even having a blurring effect making the blemish less noticeable.

The healing process after applying these are wonderful too because they do not dry your skin and the blemish is usually gone within a day or two. I have dry skin, so I stopped using spot treatments and switched to solely these because I was not a fan of the flakiness of my skin from the spot treatments. I also love knowing that my blemish is covered and protected, from everything, and even stops me from messing with it and making it worse. Not only that, but I also have skin that can be sensitive to some adhesives, but never had any issues or reactions with these. They adhere really well, and will not budge until you decided to remove them, unlike others, where I may go to bed with the patch on my face but wake up with it stuck to the pillow.

A lot of people rave about these, but I don’t think they really do anything for my acne. When I take them off, they rip the bump open and that’s it really!

This is really an excellent product it does exactly what it says --either dramatically improves or gets rid of the blemish altogether anywhere from as quickly as overnight to two to three days at most depending on the blemish you do have to apply it on clean dry skin so it sticks well I wouldn't wear it out during the day because while it is pretty sheer you can still see it because it doesn't lay flush on your skin but it does exactly what it says and it's fantastic and I can't say enough about it

Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2023

I get picky with pimples and these are a godsend—basically the only way I’ll stop is a physical barrier. These don’t suck pimple gunk out, but they definitely encourage them to come to a head if they have one. I was resistant to paying for tiny hydrocolloid patches, but these are just worth it for me. I’ve tried other pimple patches (US brands) and they frankly don’t compare.

Half half
Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023
Sometimes the patch is thicker than my *** but sometimes it’s as thin as my ***. The thick one that I got for the past 2 orders wouldn’t stick to my skin and by the time I woke up in the morning, the patch will be on my hair, my bed sheet, my back and nowhere to be found. It’s good for sure but it’s like playing a Russian roulette where the thick patch is the bullet.

Such a great value for so much less. I was obsessed with obsessed with the mighty patches put they get really expensive for not a lot especially when you have a lot of pimples. Personally I get really deep painful pimples that last forever these take them away just leashing the little red mark like the patches do. So impressed with this product and the value. Love it so much and could not recommend this more.

We put The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch to the test after receiving a complimentary sample from the brand. Keep reading for our full product review. 

Editor’s Note: We reviewed this article on September 24, 2023. As per our editorial policy, we are constantly updating our content, to make sure it reflects the best of the best when it comes to beauty, wellness, and fashion. We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.

Period, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren't blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month. 

Lucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I'll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.

Keep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.

COSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH

BEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types

KEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid

PRICE: $19

ABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.

About My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts

My skin can be unpredictable. But, as I've gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.  

Ingredients: One key, familiar ingredient 

The tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.

The Feel: Like a bandage

You can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Packaging: Easy to store

The 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish

I placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.

Even with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn't budge overnight.

If you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn't expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn't gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don't believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

The Value: Worth it

Was this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay. 

BYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT

Similar Products: You've got options 

squish. Flower Power Acne Patches ($14): This pack of 20 floral hydrocolloid pimple patches to help zap blemishes overnight and let's face it, they're pretty darn cute. Pimple, but make them pretty. 

Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Variety Pack ($7): These 36 count medical-grade, chemical-free, allergy-tested patches stay put no matter how much you toss and turn throughout the night. 

Final Verdict

If you have hormonal breakouts or single pimples that crop up, you won't regret having The Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch on hand.

9 best pimple patches to heal breakouts, according to experts
We consulted three board-certified dermatologists on the efficacy of pimple patches against breakouts, and are sharing their top-rated recommendations.
Pimple patches can help prevent you from picking your acne and diminish inflammation and discoloration, according to experts.Kara Birnbaum / Select
Jan. 16, 2021, 7:43 AM KST / Updated Oct. 6, 2023, 4:47 AM KST
By Nicole Saunders and Christina Colizza

Sleeping through your alarm or spilling coffee on your crisp, white shirt are just a few small ways to start your day on the wrong foot. And while those mishaps are certainly not ideal, almost nothing is more demoralizing than waking up to a glaring red blemish on your face.

Unfortunately, zits happen to just about everyone. In fact, acne affects more than 50 million Americans, according to the American Academy of Dermatology Association (AADA). Although getting pimples is normal, they can be painful and distracting. Pimple patches won’t get rid of acne forever, but they can help with sudden one-off blemishes.

Not familiar with these spot treatments? “Pimple patches are small stickers that are made with a soothing gel called hydrocolloid,” says Dr. Bradley Glodny, a board-certified dermatologist and owner of Park Avenue Dermatology in New York City. As this hydrocolloid gel adheres to the skin, it absorbs excess oil and dirt away from pimples, says Dr. Hadley King, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.

"While stuck to the skin, acne patches also have the added benefit of preventing you from picking or trying to pop the pimple," says King. This is key because when you pick at a pimple, it increases inflammation, can prolong healing time and boosts the risk of infection, discoloration and scarring.

SKIP AHEAD The best pimple patches of 2023 | How to shop for pimple patches | When are pimple patches most effective?

To help you determine the best pimple patch for your skin, we spoke with dermatologists about what to look for when shopping and added in highly rated options from retailers like Amazon, Target and Sephora that align with our experts’ guidance.

13 best skin care products for acne-prone skin, according to experts
How we chose the best pimple patches

To choose the best pimple patches, we asked experts what key factors to prioritize when shopping. Here is what they say to keep in mind:

Look for acne-fighting ingredients: Some pimple patches are made using only hydrocolloid gel, while others are infused with additional acne-fighting ingredients. What will work best for you will depend on your skin type, according to Dr. Orit Markowitz, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of OptiSkin Medical in New York City. If you have sensitive skin, you may want a basic hydrocolloid patch;if your zits are more stubborn, consider patches with blemish-busting ingredients like salicylic acid or tea tree oil. If you are dealing with a deep, cystic pimple, Glodny suggests looking for a patch with micropoints (also called micro darts), which are tiny points that gently penetrate the skin to deliver ingredients deeper.
Size: No two pimples are exactly alike, so different sized and shaped patches will help you target different types of breakouts. A larger sticker can tackle a cluster of pimples, while a little circle is a good choice for a small whitehead.
The best pimple patches of October 2023

We consulted three New York-based dermatologists about their top pimple patch recommendations, plus considered options that earned high ratings from Select staff members and reviewers who have used them.

Both King and Markowitz recommend Zitsticka patches, which come with priming cleaning swabs to use before applying the patch. "I like that they have micro darts filled with salicylic acid, niacinamide and oligopeptide-76 to treat pimples," says King. “It enables these ingredients, all of which help reduce acne, to really get in there.” They also contain hyaluronic acid, which balances out the potential drying effect of salicylic acid so your zit doesn’t start to flake and scab as it heals, according to Markowitz.

King is also a fan of these pimple patches, which are available in packs of 20 and 60. The patches combine hydrocolloid and salicylic acid to help remove oil and debris from clogged pores. They also contain aloe vera leaf extract, which has anti-inflammatory properties that help soothe and calm redness, according to King.

These highly-rated acne patches are ideal for dry or sensitive skin since they skip potentially drying agents, like salicylic acid. The translucent, hydrocolloid patches come in three sizes — 7mm, 10mm and 12mm, which you can use as needed to cover a single small zit or a cluster. "The smallest is one of the smallest options I've seen, and they are also thinner than most hydrocolloid patches — so this makes them easier to wear without it being obvious,” says King. To use these cleanse your skin first, apply the patch and then remove after eight hours, according to the brand.

Markowitz is a fan of these acne patches, which use ingredients like niacinamide and antioxidant-rich turmeric, to help soothe very inflamed pimples. Dr. Jart offers two types of pimple patches: a blemish option, which uses vitamin B3 to help clear breakouts and hyaluronic acid for hydration and a dark spot option, which relies on vitamin C to help fade discoloration, according to the brand. The latter is great for darker skin tones, who tend to be left with dark spots as acne heals, says Markowitz.

These patches are another favorite of King’s because of its ingredients: they have salicylic acid and hyaluronic acid to hydrate the skin, plus niacinamide, which can help improve skin tone and texture. Select’s associate updates editor, Zoe Malin, is a fan of because of how thin they are. “They are practically invisible when you put them on,” she says. “So you can totally wear them during the day when working from home — I doubt anyone would be able to tell you were wearing them on a video call.”

“The patches are very effective at extracting a pimple, but it may take a couple rounds of patches depending on how deep or large of a pimple it is,” says Select’s editorial projects associate Rebecca Rodriguez, who tried them for Select’s Wellness Awards. “I like that they’re a little more translucent than other patches I have tried because they blend well with my skin tone and don’t scream ‘hey I’ve got a pimple.’” Unlike other patches that have additional acne-fighting ingredients, these solely rely on the hydrocolloid gel to draw out any sebum or debris from your skin, which makes them gentle for sensitive skin.

Cosrx Pimple Patches

King likes these because each package contains small, medium and large hydrocolloid bandages, giving you options for pimples of different sizes. These Cosrx patches rely solely on hydrocolloid gel to remove excess oil so they’re an ideal option for anyone with sensitive skin because there are no additional ingredients to irritate you, according to King. These are also one of the most consistently highly rated options on our list with an average 4.5-star rating from 32,129 reviews on Amazon.

These fragrance-free, star-shaped patches add a little fun to your acne-fighting journey. “Getting a pimple can be such a bummer,” says contributing editor Bethany Heitman. “These bright yellow stars add an element of fun to the entire experience. Because of the shape, I found they were best for smaller zits. I mostly wear them at home. But, I did wear a few to a recent Taylor Swift concert — they covered my breakout and felt festive.” A 100% hydrocolloid option, Markowitz also says they are helpful for reducing zit-related inflammation on sensitive skin.

Another 100% hydrocolloid option, these patches from Nexcare come in a pack of 36 or 108 patches and are another favorite of Markowitz’s. Like the Mighty Patch option from Hero Cosmetics, these turn white once any oily secretion is absorbed, according to the brand. Do not combine these patches with other acne medications or treatments though, according to Nexcare.

These round, unscented patches, which have a 4.3-star average rating from 72,888 reviews on Amazon, contain tea tree oil to help shrink pimples. They’re also infused with calendula, which is known to soothe irritation, according to the brand. In the packet, you’ll get 40 patches in small, medium and large sizes.

How to shop for pimple patches

Picking the best option is all about considering your skin’s specific needs. Simple hydrocolloid patches are ideal for sensitive skin, says Glodny. If you don’t have sensitive skin, you can consider patches that either have micro darts (little points that help ingredients get deeper into a zit by creating small pricks in the skin) or the following acne-fighting ingredients:

Salicylic acid is a beta hydroxy acid that can help unclog pores or remove excess sebum. Patches containing salicylic acid could be a good option for a fairly inflamed pimple, but may irritate dryer, sensitive skin.
Tea tree oil or tea tree extract can be very drying, says Markowitz. This makes it a great tool for drying out pimples. However, if you have dry or sensitive skin, it’s probably best to skip it.
Hyaluronic acid is often paired with other, more drying ingredients like salicylic acid. That’s because it helps to hydrate the skin and can prevent drying caused by other ingredients associated with fighting acne, says King.
Niacinamide is another great addition to a pimple patch because it can improve skin tone and texture, according to King. “Plus, it has stabilizing effects on the skin’s barrier function, which can help improve moisture retention.”

As long as you're not allergic or sensitive to an ingredient found in the patches, pimple patches should not make acne worse, according to our experts. As mentioned, patches with salicylic acid or tea tree oil can be more irritating — if you have sensitive skin, skip patches with these ingredients in them.

Worried peeling the patch off will hurt or cause damage? Don’t be. Pimple patches aren’t like bandages for cuts or wounds. The hydrocolloid gel makes them less sticky, so they gently sit on top of your pimple and then easily (and gently) peel off when you’re ready. In fact, they can actually prevent scarring. These patches prevent you from picking at your blemish or trying to pop it on your own, which is what can lead to scarring and hyperpigmentation, says Glodny.

When are pimple patches most effective?

Pimple patches can be very effective on mild breakouts and superficial pimples like small whiteheads and pustules that are just popping up or that recently came to a head, says King. They can also work on cystic acne . “This type of acne sits deeper underneath the skin, making it more challenging for acne-fighting ingredients to get to,” says Glodny. “The prolonged contact that a pimple patch has (you usually keep them on for six to eight hours) means that the ingredients have time to really penetrate.” However, deeper pimples may require multiple nights of treatment with a pimple patch before they’re fully gone.

Another pro of over-the-counter pimple patches is that hydrocolloid patches generally don't dehydrate your skin or leave it flaky, compared to more harsh acne spot treatments featuring salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, according to King. She adds that pimple patches are most effective on sensitive skin and mild acne patients, although those with oily, combination, normal and even dry skin can also use them and see results.

How do you apply a pimple patch?

To avoid transferring bacteria to your pimple, wash your hands before applying a patch. Make sure your skin is clean and dry as well and skip any spot treatment creams, according to Glodny. By doubling up, you risk irritation or drying out your skin, plus, the patch won’t stay put if your skin is sticky with cream.

To adhere the patch to your pimple, peel it off the sheet and center it over your zit. Press down gently and it will stick to your skin. Then, if you need to apply other face products (like moisturizer or makeup), just avoid the area directly around the sticker, according to our experts.

I've attached the patch on troubled areas but why am I not seeing any changes?

If they are blind pimples prior to popping, the patch works to protect the affected area from external exposure, preventing further damage. Thus, visible changes may not be immediately apparent.

What about popped pimples?

When attached the hydrocolloid patch will absorb any fluids coming from the wound. During the coagulation stage, the patch may become white and swollen as it creates a humid environment to support the growth of new skin.

How is the rate of fluid absorption?

The rate of fluid absorption may vary based on the amount of fluid present.

Will the patch not come off?

The adhesive material, naturally derived from pine resin, is considerably stronger than other products. Designed with a special edge for more precision and control when placing the patch, when placed accurately at once, it will not fall off itself.

Can I reapply the patch?

The patch strongly adheres to the skin once being placed and adhesion decreases by 70% when peeled off. You can re-apply the patch, it may not adhere as well.

These are the only patches I get. They stay on better than most other patches I’ve gotten and are translucent enough to be hardly noticeable in public. They also stay on for quite a long time. They have two different sizes in the pack for small and large problem areas

 Tried several, these are my favorite!
Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2023
Pattern Name: SignatureVerified Purchase
The price per patch is unbelievable! These are such a deal!
They adhere well, without being hard to remove or painful. They have stayed on all day and all night when applied.
They do their job and absorb well, and leave me with no blemish or if it’s a big one, it is SO much smaller within 6 hours that it is almost completely gone.
These patches are incredibly thin and I even feel confident enough to wear them out of the house with no make up to cover them. That being said, they do absorb so well that what has been absorbed will be noticed after a bit. But the patch itself is thin as can be!
I do love being able to peel the patch off without having to touch it. It makes application easier and more sanitary.
These are ones I will continue to buy!

These are my new favorite pimple patches. They are the cheapest I've found that work well. I love that there are two sizes and how invisible they are. The tab helps so they don't bunch up when you peel them off the plastic and allows you to apply them without touching the sticky part.

 Okay pimple patches
Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2023
Pattern Name: ClassicVerified Purchase
These patches are okay compared to other leading/popular competitors. If you're expecting these to absorb a lot of sebum/gunk from a pimple...these don't really do that (at least for me). They're pretty good at covering up the blemishes and will slowly decrease the problem size over a few wears. I do like the tab concept. It definitely makes pulling them off the plastic -- avoiding foldover and putting them on a lot easier.

I've attached the patch on troubled areas but why am I not seeing any changes?

If they are blind pimples prior to popping, the patch works to protect the affected area from external exposure, preventing further damage. Thus, visible changes may not be immediately apparent.

What about popped pimples?

When attached the hydrocolloid patch will absorb any fluids coming from the wound. During the coagulation stage, the patch may become white and swollen as it creates a humid environment to support the growth of new skin.

How is the rate of fluid absorption?

The rate of fluid absorption may vary based on the amount of fluid present.

Will the patch not come off?

The adhesive material, naturally derived from pine resin, is considerably stronger than other products. Designed with a special edge for more precision and control when placing the patch, when placed accurately at once, it will not fall off itself.

Can I reapply the patch?

The patch adheres strongly to the skin once placed and adhesion decreases by 70% when peeled off. You can re-apply the patch but it may not adhere as well.

These are the only patches I get. They stay on better than most other patches I’ve gotten and are translucent enough to be hardly noticeable in public. They also stay on for quite a long time. They have two different sizes in the pack for small and large problem areas

The price per patch is unbelievable! These are such a deal!
They adhere well, without being hard to remove or painful. They have stayed on all day and all night when applied.
They do their job and absorb well, and leave me with no blemish or if it’s a big one, it is SO much smaller within 6 hours that it is almost completely gone.
These patches are incredibly thin and I even feel confident enough to wear them out of the house with no make up to cover them. That being said, they do absorb so well that what has been absorbed will be noticed after a bit. But the patch itself is thin as can be!
I do love being able to peel the patch off without having to touch it. It makes application easier and more sanitary.
These are ones I will continue to buy!

I have found a replacement for Rael acne miracle pimple patch! These are thin and stick well to the skin. It is quite invisible. Not like my recent purchase of Rael pimple patches that kept falling off and were quite visible on my skin.

These are my new favorite pimple patches. They are the cheapest I've found that work well. I love that there are two sizes and how invisible they are. The tab helps so they don't bunch up when you peel them off the plastic and allows you to apply them without touching the sticky part.

 Okay pimple patches
Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2023
Pattern Name: ClassicVerified Purchase
These patches are okay compared to other leading/popular competitors. If you're expecting these to absorb a lot of sebum/gunk from a pimple...these don't really do that (at least for me). They're pretty good at covering up the blemishes and will slowly decrease the problem size over a few wears. I do like the tab concept. It definitely makes pulling them off the plastic -- avoiding foldover and putting them on a lot easier.

Best for acne

It’s so strange to think that we used to get by without pimple patches. Now, if you notice an angry zit developing, you pop on a pimple patch for a few hours and the sticker will suck the nastiness out of your skin. Each week, it seems that another new pimple patch has entered the market, so we spoke to skin-care experts — including board-certified dermatologists and our resident beauty writer — to find out what to look for in a pimple patch and which ones are the best. But before reading on, take stock of the one piece of advice all of our experts were unanimous about: Stop picking your pimples!

What we’re looking for
Ingredients

Hydrocolloid — a fluid-absorbing gel — is the ingredient in most pimple patches. “Hydrocolloids are wound dressings that have been used for decades on the skin for chronic ulcers, trauma wounds, and even burns,” says Dr. Jamie Glick, a dermatologist at New York Dermatology Group. You may have already used a hydrocolloid patch to treat a blister or small wound, and the process with pimple patches is the same: They draw out any excess oil and gunk. The patches also help acne blemishes to heal by acting as a physical barrier, keeping out bacteria and stopping you from picking. “Long before I was a dermatologist, my mother used to say, ‘Touching a pimple is like watering a plant — it will grow and grow,’” Glick says. “I use that phrase all the time with my patients and recommend acne patches especially to my patients who are pickers.”

Some other common ingredients in pimple patches include active acne-treating topicals like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and tea-tree oil. But Dr. Amy Perlmutter, also of the New York Dermatology Group, recommends “sticking with the hydrocolloid-only patches unless evaluated by a dermatologist and instructed otherwise. This is because patches with active acne-fighting ingredients have the potential to irritate and/or dry out the skin.” If your skin is sensitive, that’s an even higher risk for you.

Appearance

The majority of pimple patches are designed to look as imperceptible as possible, so in theory, you can pop one on and head out without it being super-obvious. Most of the patches on this list, then, are small, thin, transparent dots, making them hard to spot on any skin tone. But that’s not always the case. I’ve outlined what each patch looks like and what sizes they come in to best suit your needs.

Price

Beneath each pack, I’ve made a note of the price per patch.

Best patches overall
Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Original Acne Patches
$12 now 20% off
$10 for 36

Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dot, one size (12 mm) | Price: $0.36 per patch

Dr. Perlmutter recommends these patches from Hero Cosmetics. They contain medical-grade hydrocolloid to remove excess fluid and oils from blemishes, but she says they also “maintain optimum PH level and temperature, which helps prevent bacterial overgrowth and promote healing.” Mighty Patches take about six to eight hours to work, so they are a great option to use overnight. Any oil sucked out turns white on the transparent patch, so you can really see the benefit. These patches contain only hydrocolloid, so they shouldn’t dry out sensitive skin. They’re also transparent — turning slightly opaque once they’re finished — so look subtle on a variety of skin tones. Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Margarita Lolis also finds that as the patches are matte, they blend in well if you’re layering foundation over them. They’re also great value for money.

Best less-expensive patches
The Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch
$6

Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dot, mix of medium (10 mm) and large (14 mm) | Price: $0.14

At $6 for 42 patches — or just $0.14 per sticker — the Klog patches are amazing value. “The patch is thinner and almost clear, which helps it camouflage better into most skin tones,” says Carmen Castilla, M.D., who also appreciates the mix of patch sizes for different-size pimples. “Hydrocolloid patches are also unlikely to cause irritation, so they work well even on those with more sensitive skin types,” she says.

Best patches for whiteheads
COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch
$6 for 24

Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dot, mix of small (7 mm), medium (10 mm) and large (12 mm) | Price: $0.25 per patch

“Cosrx Pimple Patches are the holy grail. Drop everything and buy them,” says Strategist beauty writer Rio Viera-Newton. She recommended these patches in her original skin-care Google doc and thinks that they work best for extracting every last bit of gunk from whiteheads. “If you pop or pick a zit, put this on immediately afterward, go to bed, and in the morning, you’ll see what I’m talking about and thank me.” And while we’re not recommending picking, hey — we know it happens.

$6 FOR 24 AT DERMSTORE
Best patches for body acne
Neutrogena Stubborn Acne Ultra-Thin Blemish Patches
$8

Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dots or triangles, exact size not listed | Price: $0.33 per patch

Dr. Perlmutter also likes these ultrathin options from Neutrogena, which are more discreet when applied. They’re available in either dot or triangle shapes, with the latter specifically designed for angling on the side of your nose or for treating larger breakouts on the back or the chest. Containing just hydrocolloid, they’re nondrying and nonirritating.

Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Invisible+
$18 now 22% off
$14

Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Ultra-thin transparent dots, mix of small (10 mm) and medium (12 mm) | Price: $0.46 per patch

These patches, another by Mighty Patch, are a favorite of both Dr. Shereene Idriss, a board-certified dermatologist, and Viera-Newton. They’re great because they’re “super-ultrathin, so you can barely see them — sometimes I even lose track of where I’ve put them when I look in the mirror,” says Viera-Newton. “On days where I have a really bad zit and want it to be protected from the horrible grime of the city, I use these. I’ve even thrown some concealer on top of it to further disguise it.” Again, they contain only hydrocolloid, so they are kind to sensitive skin.

Starface Hydro-Stars Starter Pack (32-Count)
$15

Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Neon yellow stars, 12 mm | Price: $0.46 per patch

Dr Idriss, Viera-Newton, and Dr. Perlmutter each recommend these fun pimple patches (that you’re sure to have seen on your feed at least once.) Each one is shaped like a star and uses hydrocolloid to draw out oil and gunk from pimples. They inject a bit of whimsy into not picking away at your face all day — at an affordable price point.

$15 AT AMAZON
$15 AT STARFACE
Best colorful patches with darts
Starface Micro-cloud
$18

Ingredients: Hydrocolloid, niacinamide, and salicylic acid | Appearance: Baby-blue clouds, 12 mm. | Price: $1.50 per patch

“The blue cloud patch is fun if you are not trying to camouflage the fact you have a pimple patch on,” says Dr. Castilla. But these cloud-shaped patches differ from the original Starface patches beyond just the look, says dermatologist Dr. Kristina Collins. In addition to hydrocolloid, they have darts that contain niacinamide and salicylic acid. The hydrocolloid dressing protects the affected area from dirt and will also help absorb pus and oil away from the skin, while the salicylic acid helps increase cell turnover and dissolve any dead skin cells clogging the pores. Niacinamide then helps to reduce inflammation.

The patches are ideal for targeting cystic pimples in the early stages. If you feel the signature aching of a gnarly under-the-skin pimple, that’s the ideal time to press one on. However, as the additional ingredients may cause irritation, neither doctor recommends these patches to those with sensitive skin, instead pointing patients back toward the original Starface patches.

$18 AT STARFACE
Best patches for larger spots
Acropass Trouble Cure
$18

Ingredients: Tea tree, salicylic acid, hyaluronic acid | Appearance: Transparent dots, one size (not listed) | Price: $3 per treatment (a wipe and a patch)

The Acropass Trouble Cure is actually a two-step process involving a wipe that treats your skin before you apply the patch. The wipe pairs acne-fighting tea-tree oil and salicylic acid, which can dry the skin, but the patch adds moisture back. “The Acropass has teeny-tiny microneedles infused with hyaluronic acid, an ingredient that deeply hydrates the skin, and niacinamide, a form of vitamin B3, which has brightening and soothing effects,” explains Viera-Newton. “The microneedles — which, I know, sound scary — are so thin you can barely feel them, and they puncture the zit to attack it from the inside out.” After testing them on a few different types of blemish, Viera-Newton says these work best on large, intimidating, unpoppable spots.

Best patches for hormonal acne
ZitSticka Killa Kit 8-Pack
$29

Ingredients: Salicylic acid, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid | Appearance: Transparent dots (one size, not listed) | Price: $3.62 per patch

“Into adulthood, I’ve still been plagued with monthly flare-ups of hormonal cysts on my chin. Like clockwork, the deep, painful, under-the-skin growths erupt to trumpet the arrival of my period,” says Strategist writer Dominique Pariso. After testing a few pimple patches and getting nowhere, she decided to try the multistep patches from ZitSticka. They work in a similar way to the Acropass patches — micro-darts push salicylic acid, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid into the skin. But the ZitSticka patches also have a hydrocolloid top layer, meaning they can fight acne before it develops. “The first time I slapped the patches on before bed, I woke up to find that the monster welts lurking beneath my face were flatter, calmer, and less red than they had been the night before,” says Pariso, whose cysts now clear up in a couple of days as opposed to a couple of weeks.

$29 AT AMAZON
Best easy-to-apply patches
Bioré Cover & Conquer Blemish Patches
$12

Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dots, 15 mm. | Price: $0.40 per patch

“Bioré patches feature perforated packaging, which makes it easier to get the pimple patch off without bending the corners,” says Dr. Castilla. That’s important because “if the corners are bent, the pimple patch is more visible and doesn’t stick as well. It also allows you to put the patch on without touching the part that will lay on your skin, meaning the patch itself stays clean.” As the Bioré patches are just hydrocolloid, without any active ingredients, they’re suitable for even sensitive skin, but the patches do only come in one size, so they’re not the best option if you want a wide variety.

1. A cult-favorite box of Mighty Patch Original hydrocolloid patches with 42,000+ 5-star reviews claiming these things are actual magic.
amazon.com, amazon.com

By the way, hydrocolloid patches are most effective at treating acne that has already come to the surface (aka when you can see a whitehead). Once it's reached that stage, the patch can pull out any fluid, dead skin, bacteria, or whatever else is hiding in there way more easily than if there are multiple layers of skin over the pimple.

We also gave these pimple patches a shoutout in "21 In-Flight Beauty Products Perfect For Your Next Plane Ride."

Promising review: "Witchcraft? I do not claim to understand the science behind these tiny miracles, but they have changed my life. I spent my workday looking forward to going home and putting one of these bad boys on my newly erupted Mt. Zit and the overnight results were shocking. Not only is it grossly satisfying, but it saved me several days of walking around with a bloody crater in my face because my previous method of dealing with unsightly blemishes was to pick pick pick." —Adg

Promising review: "WHAT THE GUNK! Buy these! NOW! Omg the junk that these strips pulled out of the pores of my chin and nose was incredible. I could feel a blemish starting on my chin it didn’t stand a chance to this patch. I wore it overnight while I slept and when I woke up I took it off and was amazed! No blemish – just a huge white blob on the patch! I also applied one to my nose to see what would come out and there was so much oil and tiny whiteheads on the strip! I was skeptical but now I’m a believer and will be purchasing more!" —jen

3. A pimple patch with salicylic acid, tea tree oil, hyaluronic acid, and more so it'll absorb gunk while also moisturizing *and* treating flare-ups and redness. We love an overachiever.
amazon.com, amazon.com

Promising review: "Like most acne products, I was afraid they would be too drying or just not work. I was so surprised! They reduced the appearance (redness/swelling) of acne and also helped it heal considerably faster! Not only did they work great on the acne, but the skin they were applied to was visibly better/healthier looking than the untreated area! Not only was the skin NOT dried out, but it appeared more moisturized and pores were even less visible! They are a nice neutral, blending color. I love that you get three sizes and 120 in a pack! It absolutely makes it worth the price! I think the magic ingredient that puts these way above the competitors is hyaluronic acid. Instead of just drying your pimple/skin out, the HA keeps your skin moisturized and looking great! I'm now a customer for life! Try these! You won't be disappointed! :-)" —Courtney

Promising review: "After one try I LOVE these!! When I removed the patch from my problem area, I could see on the spot itself had something on it! The swelling had gone down significantly, and there was no longer a visible head on my zit. I was seriously shocked. And for after just one overnight use! I continued putting patches on it and the spot on my face is healed after just a couple of days. These patches have worked wonderfully on my less severe zits, as well. They’ve taken redness away and the zits just start to heal instead of needing to come to a head and be popped. Try these! You won’t regret it!" —Sean M

Promising review: "After slapping one of these patches on a pimple before bed, I woke up amazed. All the 'goo' had been sucked out of my skin onto the patch and just a tiny speckle remained. The pimple was gone by the next day. It didn't hang around for days, giving me opportunities to poke and prod it and cause scarring. These are even good for when you can just feel a pimple about to pop up, use one preemptively for a couple of nights, and it doesn't even let the thing turn into an actual zit. I've tried a few other brands but the Alba are my favorite. They're priced well, you get a lot of patches, different sized patches, they work well, and they have salicylic acid." —Molly D

Promising review: "I have literally never written a review for anything in my entire life, but I feel compelled to share my experience with this product. I visited my doctor for my acne and was put on antibiotics to no avail. I went into panic mode and spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on new makeup and every skincare product and every prescription cream known to mankind. Then I came across these little patches. I put them on overnight and woke up feeling both impressed and disgusted by what I peeled off. My skin wasn’t irritated and the redness was reduced, but the acne was still very much present. I wore them to bed again that night and woke up the next morning to find that for the first time in months, my skin appeared to be healing. I was so excited that I actually almost cried. I was so encouraged that I put more patches on and wore them around the house for the rest of the day and evening, and I am not kidding when I tell you that I took them off before bed to find that my acne, which had completely withstood the test of every dermatologist recommendation for months, was all but gone. GONE! I could not believe my eyes. Do not hesitate for even one moment to buy these little suckers!" —Jennifer Gruselle

Promising review: "I am absolutely shocked at the quality of this product. I was desperate to find something to help cover and heal my acne, especially since I work in customer service and I am interacting with people all day long so I need to feel my best and most confident. I have a nasty habit of touching my acne and making it worse and this product helps protect my skin from that. It is virtually unnoticeable and most people do not see it unless I pointed it out. I will say that the 12-mm patches are more noticeable than the 10 mm patches. However, they are still very hard to see. When they are in a spot that moves a lot, such as around your mouth or in between your eyebrows, I do notice that the patch can wrinkle a little bit. But I am also wearing them for my 8+ hour shifts so that is to be expected. Taking off the patch is incredibly satisfying. It does pull out impurities and toxins...you can really tell that it was absorbing and pulling out toxins." —Berit K. Thompson

I was hesitant to try it out at first when my sister recommended it to me, but whatever doubts I had for sticky patches to magically remove pimples were proven wrong when I tried it. The patches work in hours, sometimes even instantly (depending on how raised the pimple is), sucking out all the pus of a whitehead or soothing down a red bump overnight. They're perfect to use especially when you're under time constraints (for an interview or occasion)! The best thing is that as soon as you clean up the spot where you removed it, it barely leaves any dark spots or traces behind a few days later. I appreciate this because I have an issue with hyperpigmentation, but I don't need to worry about it much with these patches.10/10 recommend!" —Hadeer Leila

These little tabs are clear and painless. They come in different sizes and are barely noticeable when worn. They also stay in place really well. I’ve even left one on during a shower and it didn’t budge. The best results happen overnight. You put one on overnight and by morning the blemish is smaller, less red, and less painful. There’s no peeling or burning since it doesn’t contain salicylic acid. You’ll notice a 'center' start to form on the dot that is white or cloudy and that’s how you know it’s doing its job. That center is the goopy stuff being drawn from the offending blemish. Mysteriously, the area that was a pimple won’t have a scab or watery ooziness or even a 'head.' It will just be a mini version of its former self. Clean your face, put a fresh patch on, and the next morning it’s gone." —Darci

By the end of the first day, the cyst had shrunk in size by at least 50%. By the end of day two, it had formed a head and burst on its own. By the end of day three, the cyst was completely drained and flat, and the only visible sign of it was a small scab. But on day two of neck zit, I noticed another smaller pimple coming up on my chin. I wore the patches overnight and by the morning it had completely come to the surface rather than stewing under the skin for days. By the end of day two, it popped, and by the end of day three, it’s gone. These will definitely stay stockpiled in my home from now on!" —amanda

It’s so strange to think that we used to get by without pimple patches. Now, if you notice an angry zit developing, you pop on a pimple patch for a few hours and the sticker will suck the nastiness out of your skin. Each week, it seems that another new pimple patch has entered the market, so we spoke to skin-care experts — including board-certified dermatologists and our resident beauty writer — to find out what to look for in a pimple patch and which ones are the best. But before reading on, take stock of the one piece of advice all of our experts were unanimous about: Stop picking your pimples!

What we’re looking for
Ingredients

Hydrocolloid — a fluid-absorbing gel — is the ingredient in most pimple patches. “Hydrocolloids are wound dressings that have been used for decades on the skin for chronic ulcers, trauma wounds, and even burns,” says Dr. Jamie Glick, a dermatologist at New York Dermatology Group. You may have already used a hydrocolloid patch to treat a blister or small wound, and the process with pimple patches is the same: They draw out any excess oil and gunk. The patches also help acne blemishes to heal by acting as a physical barrier, keeping out bacteria and stopping you from picking. “Long before I was a dermatologist, my mother used to say, ‘Touching a pimple is like watering a plant — it will grow and grow,’” Glick says. “I use that phrase all the time with my patients and recommend acne patches especially to my patients who are pickers.”

Some other common ingredients in pimple patches include active acne-treating topicals like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and tea-tree oil. But Dr. Amy Perlmutter, also of the New York Dermatology Group, recommends “sticking with the hydrocolloid-only patches unless evaluated by a dermatologist and instructed otherwise. This is because patches with active acne-fighting ingredients have the potential to irritate and/or dry out the skin.” If your skin is sensitive, that’s an even higher risk for you.

Appearance

The majority of pimple patches are designed to look as imperceptible as possible, so in theory, you can pop one on and head out without it being super-obvious. Most of the patches on this list, then, are small, thin, transparent dots, making them hard to spot on any skin tone. But that’s not always the case. I’ve outlined what each patch looks like and what sizes they come in to best suit your needs.

Price

Beneath each pack, I’ve made a note of the price per patch.

Best patches overall
Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Original Acne Patches
$12 now 20% off
$10 for 36

Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dot, one size (12 mm) | Price: $0.36 per patch

Dr. Perlmutter recommends these patches from Hero Cosmetics. They contain medical-grade hydrocolloid to remove excess fluid and oils from blemishes, but she says they also “maintain optimum PH level and temperature, which helps prevent bacterial overgrowth and promote healing.” Mighty Patches take about six to eight hours to work, so they are a great option to use overnight. Any oil sucked out turns white on the transparent patch, so you can really see the benefit. These patches contain only hydrocolloid, so they shouldn’t dry out sensitive skin. They’re also transparent — turning slightly opaque once they’re finished — so look subtle on a variety of skin tones. Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Margarita Lolis also finds that as the patches are matte, they blend in well if you’re layering foundation over them. They’re also great value for money.

Best less-expensive patches
The Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch
$6

Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dot, mix of medium (10 mm) and large (14 mm) | Price: $0.14

At $6 for 42 patches — or just $0.14 per sticker — the Klog patches are amazing value. “The patch is thinner and almost clear, which helps it camouflage better into most skin tones,” says Carmen Castilla, M.D., who also appreciates the mix of patch sizes for different-size pimples. “Hydrocolloid patches are also unlikely to cause irritation, so they work well even on those with more sensitive skin types,” she says.

Best patches for whiteheads
COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch
$6 for 24

Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dot, mix of small (7 mm), medium (10 mm) and large (12 mm) | Price: $0.25 per patch

“Cosrx Pimple Patches are the holy grail. Drop everything and buy them,” says Strategist beauty writer Rio Viera-Newton. She recommended these patches in her original skin-care Google doc and thinks that they work best for extracting every last bit of gunk from whiteheads. “If you pop or pick a zit, put this on immediately afterward, go to bed, and in the morning, you’ll see what I’m talking about and thank me.” And while we’re not recommending picking, hey — we know it happens.

Neutrogena Stubborn Acne Ultra-Thin Blemish Patches
$8

Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dots or triangles, exact size not listed | Price: $0.33 per patch

Dr. Perlmutter also likes these ultrathin options from Neutrogena, which are more discreet when applied. They’re available in either dot or triangle shapes, with the latter specifically designed for angling on the side of your nose or for treating larger breakouts on the back or the chest. Containing just hydrocolloid, they’re nondrying and nonirritating.

Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Invisible+
$18 now 22% off
$14

Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Ultra-thin transparent dots, mix of small (10 mm) and medium (12 mm) | Price: $0.46 per patch

These patches, another by Mighty Patch, are a favorite of both Dr. Shereene Idriss, a board-certified dermatologist, and Viera-Newton. They’re great because they’re “super-ultrathin, so you can barely see them — sometimes I even lose track of where I’ve put them when I look in the mirror,” says Viera-Newton. “On days where I have a really bad zit and want it to be protected from the horrible grime of the city, I use these. I’ve even thrown some concealer on top of it to further disguise it.” Again, they contain only hydrocolloid, so they are kind to sensitive skin.

Starface Hydro-Stars Starter Pack (32-Count)
$15

Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Neon yellow stars, 12 mm | Price: $0.46 per patch

Dr Idriss, Viera-Newton, and Dr. Perlmutter each recommend these fun pimple patches (that you’re sure to have seen on your feed at least once.) Each one is shaped like a star and uses hydrocolloid to draw out oil and gunk from pimples. They inject a bit of whimsy into not picking away at your face all day — at an affordable price point.

$15 AT STARFACE
Best colorful patches with darts
Starface Micro-cloud
$18

Ingredients: Hydrocolloid, niacinamide, and salicylic acid | Appearance: Baby-blue clouds, 12 mm. | Price: $1.50 per patch

“The blue cloud patch is fun if you are not trying to camouflage the fact you have a pimple patch on,” says Dr. Castilla. But these cloud-shaped patches differ from the original Starface patches beyond just the look, says dermatologist Dr. Kristina Collins. In addition to hydrocolloid, they have darts that contain niacinamide and salicylic acid. The hydrocolloid dressing protects the affected area from dirt and will also help absorb pus and oil away from the skin, while the salicylic acid helps increase cell turnover and dissolve any dead skin cells clogging the pores. Niacinamide then helps to reduce inflammation.

The patches are ideal for targeting cystic pimples in the early stages. If you feel the signature aching of a gnarly under-the-skin pimple, that’s the ideal time to press one on. However, as the additional ingredients may cause irritation, neither doctor recommends these patches to those with sensitive skin, instead pointing patients back toward the original Starface patches.

Best patches for larger spots
Acropass Trouble Cure
$18

Ingredients: Tea tree, salicylic acid, hyaluronic acid | Appearance: Transparent dots, one size (not listed) | Price: $3 per treatment (a wipe and a patch)

The Acropass Trouble Cure is actually a two-step process involving a wipe that treats your skin before you apply the patch. The wipe pairs acne-fighting tea-tree oil and salicylic acid, which can dry the skin, but the patch adds moisture back. “The Acropass has teeny-tiny microneedles infused with hyaluronic acid, an ingredient that deeply hydrates the skin, and niacinamide, a form of vitamin B3, which has brightening and soothing effects,” explains Viera-Newton. “The microneedles — which, I know, sound scary — are so thin you can barely feel them, and they puncture the zit to attack it from the inside out.” After testing them on a few different types of blemish, Viera-Newton says these work best on large, intimidating, unpoppable spots.

“Into adulthood, I’ve still been plagued with monthly flare-ups of hormonal cysts on my chin. Like clockwork, the deep, painful, under-the-skin growths erupt to trumpet the arrival of my period,” says Strategist writer Dominique Pariso. After testing a few pimple patches and getting nowhere, she decided to try the multistep patches from ZitSticka. They work in a similar way to the Acropass patches — micro-darts push salicylic acid, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid into the skin. But the ZitSticka patches also have a hydrocolloid top layer, meaning they can fight acne before it develops. “The first time I slapped the patches on before bed, I woke up to find that the monster welts lurking beneath my face were flatter, calmer, and less red than they had been the night before,” says Pariso, whose cysts now clear up in a couple of days as opposed to a couple of weeks.

Bioré Cover & Conquer Blemish Patches
$12

Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dots, 15 mm. | Price: $0.40 per patch

“Bioré patches feature perforated packaging, which makes it easier to get the pimple patch off without bending the corners,” says Dr. Castilla. That’s important because “if the corners are bent, the pimple patch is more visible and doesn’t stick as well. It also allows you to put the patch on without touching the part that will lay on your skin, meaning the patch itself stays clean.” As the Bioré patches are just hydrocolloid, without any active ingredients, they’re suitable for even sensitive skin, but the patches do only come in one size, so they’re not the best option if you want a wide variety.

Live by Acne Patches? Dermatologists Share the Best 15 Brands of 2023

With faves from Hero Cosmetics, Peace Out, Clearasil, and more.

BYRDIE / JACLYN MASTROPASQUA

There's no shortage of over-the-counter products for clearing breakouts. But when you only have one or two zits at any given time, there's no need to treat your entire face. Enter the pimple patch, a targeted way to zap acne without exposing the rest of your skin to undue drying or irritation. According to board-certified dermatologist Sheilagh Maguiness, MD, acne patches typically contain hydrocolloid gel,1 which is often used in wound care. Hydrocolloid patches are able to keep the spot moist in order to accelerate healing and protect. In addition to healing blemishes, Dr. Maguiness notes, "The hydrocolloid in the acne sticker can help absorb sebum and dirt." 

Claire Wolinsky, MD, a New York dermatologist specializing in facial rejuvenation, says she loves pimple patches and recommends them frequently: "One reason they are particularly helpful in treating acne is because once covered, patients can't pick or squeeze their pimple, which reduces the risk of infection and bacteria." And with less trauma to the skin, Dr. Wolinsky says you're less likely to experience scarring or discoloration.

We conducted hours of research on the best acne patches, evaluating each on active ingredients to target acne as well as ingredients to soothe skin and prevent redness. We also looked at things like how easy they are to apply and how well they stay on. After considering dozens of brands and consulting with two celebrity dermatologists, we landed on the following best in show.

What We Like

Reduces redness

What We Don't Like

Only one size

Celebrity aesthetician Joshua Ross of SkinLab stands behind Peace Out Acne Healing Dots. "They employ hydrocolloid2 technology that helps extract impurities and guards against external elements," he explains. What's more, the patches create a barrier between pimples and your bacteria-laden fingers while delivering a time-released infusion of ingredients.

Cosmetic nurse Kristina Kitsos is also a fan of Peace Out. "They contain salicylic acid,3 which penetrates pores to target acne blemishes and blackheads," she tells Byrdie. Additionally, Kitsos appreciates that these acne patches contain soothing aloe vera to minimize redness and skin-clearing standby vitamin A (aka retinol).4 She says that since they're formulated with hydrating ingredients, the skin is able to heal quicker and better than if a drying, alcohol formula was used.

Who It's For

If you have skin that dries out or breaks easily, this is a great pick because of the inclusion of aloe vera—which can soothe and hydrate. Even pimple patches can sometimes tear the sensitive skin around a blemish, but you won't have to worry about that with these.

Thinner patch than other options

While most pimple patches aren't very pricey, The Klog's Soft Shield is one of the budget-friendliest of the bunch. Containing vegan hydrocolloid,2 the protective yet breathable barrier draws out impurities and helps your zits heal as quickly as possible. We love that these super-thin patches are almost invisible—perfect for wear during the day. They're unnoticeable whether you're in a virtual meeting or on a walk, and they'll keep your skin shielded from bacteria (and your fingers).

Who It's For

These pimple patches can be super helpful for those who find it hard to stop themselves from picking since they are so lightweight they can be worn anytime. They're also great for people on a budget or for those looking for a vegan formula patch.

A few drugstore brands have hopped on the pimple-patch bandwagon, but the best iteration comes from acne-fighting all-star Clearasil. Stick on the Spot Patches before bed, get your beauty sleep, and wake up to noticeable improvements in the size and redness of your blemishes. These patches have thinner, smooth edges, so they're able to adhere to the skin better without budging.

Who It's For

If you're a wild sleeper and often wake up to your pimple patch on your pillow, we recommend these.

What We Like

Contains skin-clearing and moisturizing ingredients

What We Don't Like

Doesn't contain hydrocolloid

Peter Thomas Roth's take on the acne patch is the super-moisturizing Invisible Dots. In addition to acne-clearing mainstays salicylic acid5 and tea tree oil,6 they call on hyaluronic acid7 to deliver much-needed moisture to the bumps that lie beneath. These aren't hydrocolloid patches, so they won't absorb the gunk out of a pimple that's already come to a head.

Who It's For

We recommend these patches for big, red pimples that you want to reduce in size quickly. They can work overnight to greatly shrink blemishes.

What We Don't Like

More effective on pimples that have come to a head

Dr. Wolinsky is a fan of COSRX Master Patches, and we're here for it. Serving up a heaping dose of hydrocolloid8 underneath each hygienic sticker, you can target even the most stubborn bumps with little effort. We also like that these Korean patches come in three different sizes.

When we tested them for ourselves, we loved that they didn't budge while we slept (even when applied over our nighttime serums). The pimple was noticeably smaller in the morning, and the patches kept the blemish from becoming irritated during use.

Who It's For

These patches come in three different sizes to best fit whatever type of pimple you have. This is a great choice if you deal with frequent acne of all kinds and need a patch that can fit both smaller and larger blemishes.

Comes with a small amount of patches

When you're dealing with hormonal acne, standard pimple patches often aren't able to reach the nodules under the skin, which can be painful and difficult to get rid of. These patches are the ones that you'll want to try to get those hard-to-reach blemishes. It has a two-step process: swipe the pad (which is infused with tea tree oil and salicylic acid) on clean skin and then apply the patch directly to the blemish. It's made with super-fine microneedles so that the ingredients are able to penetrate the skin better, and the patch is also formulated with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and peptides to hydrate and heal the affected area and effectively flatten the pimple.


Who It's For

If you've tried everything for hormonal acne and are looking for a targeted, effective treatment without taking a trip to the dermatologist, these are a great pick. Because of the powerful formula, you should be able to see results overnight.

Pimple patches are usually clear, but you can still often see the thick material—especially on darker skin tones or under makeup. If you have a blemish that you feel the need to conceal during the day, we recommend reaching for these patches from Rael. They have super thin edges that stick onto the skin seamlessly and lay as flat as possible for a hydrocolloid patch. Even though they're less noticeable than others on the market, they're still just as effective at protecting from bacteria and removing impurities from the spot overnight.


Who It's For

Picking at your skin is a hard habit to break, but it's necessary in order to not make blemishes worse and create a scar. Wearing a pimple patch throughout the day can help, and these patches from Rael will go unnoticed while you're out with friends or even at work.

Price at time of publish: $17

Active Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 96 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes

Where We Stand

The best pimple patches overall are Peace Out Acne Healing Dots. They contain hydrocolloid, and also a blend of soothing and clearing ingredients like retinol, salicylic acid, and aloe. For a more affordable option, consider The Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch, a breathable yet protective solution that draws out impurities and speeds up healing.

What to Look for When Buying Acne Patches
Hydrocolloid: "The most important thing is that the stickers or patches are made of hydrocolloid," Dr. Wolinsky tells Byrdie, which is "something dermatologists have used for wound care for a long time." The healing ingredient seals the skin underneath the patch while absorbing fluid, flattening bumps, and minimizing inflammation.8Some options, like Peach Slices Acne Spot Dots, are made with nothing more than hydrocolloid, which does an excellent job taking care of pimples on its own.
Active Ingredients: Most acne patches utilize hydrocolloid, which can be very effective on its own. However, you'll also find options containing a range of other acne-fighting ingredients. As Dr. Wolinsky notes, "Some of these patches have salicylic acid, which may help further treat a nasty breakout." Additionally, you might see soothing aloe vera extract,14 resurfacing retinol,4 complexion-clearing tea tree oil,15 or hydrating hyaluronic acid12 on the ingredients list.
Dime Beauty Power Patches are an excellent choice if you're looking for something containing salicylic acid, and Peter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots are a great option with tea tree oil. Some patches, like Mario Badescu Drying Patches, contain both.
Size: Since pimples and breakouts come in all shapes and sizes, it's nice to have a couple of different acne patches to work with. While many brands offer only one size, some packs include two or even three sizes to cover large and small zits accordingly. For instance, The Klog's Soft Shield Pimple Patches come with two sizes. You'll also find extra-large patches, which are meant to cover multi-bump breakouts.
FAQ
How do acne patches work?

"Most acne patches work by providing a moist occluded environment so that the acne lesion can heal underneath," says Dr. Maguiness. They typically contain hydrocolloid,8 which, as Dr. Wolinsky explains, absorbs the inflammatory fluid, flattens the bump, and speeds up healing. "The added bonus is that they keep fingers off and prevent picking," notes Dr. Maguiness.


How do you apply acne patches?

Starting with freshly washed hands and clean, dry skin, carefully peel the patch off the sheet. Then, gently stick it on the pimple in question, aligning the center of the patch with the center of the pimple. Leave it on for 12 to 24 hours or until it turns opaque.


How often should you use acne patches?

Generally speaking, you can use acne patches as often as needed. Since they target only a very small portion of your skin, you shouldn't have to worry about irritating the rest of your face or neck. In some cases, you might need to use two or three consecutive patches to get rid of a particularly stubborn pimple.

9 best pimple patches to heal breakouts, according to experts
We consulted three board-certified dermatologists on the efficacy of pimple patches against breakouts, and are sharing their top-rated recommendations.
Pimple patches can help prevent you from picking your acne and diminish inflammation and discoloration, according to experts.Kara Birnbaum / Select
Jan. 16, 2021, 7:43 AM KST / Updated Oct. 6, 2023, 4:47 AM KST
By Nicole Saunders and Christina Colizza

Sleeping through your alarm or spilling coffee on your crisp, white shirt are just a few small ways to start your day on the wrong foot. And while those mishaps are certainly not ideal, almost nothing is more demoralizing than waking up to a glaring red blemish on your face.

Unfortunately, zits happen to just about everyone. In fact, acne affects more than 50 million Americans, according to the American Academy of Dermatology Association (AADA). Although getting pimples is normal, they can be painful and distracting. Pimple patches won’t get rid of acne forever, but they can help with sudden one-off blemishes.

Not familiar with these spot treatments? “Pimple patches are small stickers that are made with a soothing gel called hydrocolloid,” says Dr. Bradley Glodny, a board-certified dermatologist and owner of Park Avenue Dermatology in New York City. As this hydrocolloid gel adheres to the skin, it absorbs excess oil and dirt away from pimples, says Dr. Hadley King, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.

"While stuck to the skin, acne patches also have the added benefit of preventing you from picking or trying to pop the pimple," says King. This is key because when you pick at a pimple, it increases inflammation, can prolong healing time and boosts the risk of infection, discoloration and scarring.

SKIP AHEAD The best pimple patches of 2023 | How to shop for pimple patches | When are pimple patches most effective?

To help you determine the best pimple patch for your skin, we spoke with dermatologists about what to look for when shopping and added in highly rated options from retailers like Amazon, Target and Sephora that align with our experts’ guidance.

13 best skin care products for acne-prone skin, according to experts
How we chose the best pimple patches

To choose the best pimple patches, we asked experts what key factors to prioritize when shopping. Here is what they say to keep in mind:

Look for acne-fighting ingredients: Some pimple patches are made using only hydrocolloid gel, while others are infused with additional acne-fighting ingredients. What will work best for you will depend on your skin type, according to Dr. Orit Markowitz, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of OptiSkin Medical in New York City. If you have sensitive skin, you may want a basic hydrocolloid patch;if your zits are more stubborn, consider patches with blemish-busting ingredients like salicylic acid or tea tree oil. If you are dealing with a deep, cystic pimple, Glodny suggests looking for a patch with micropoints (also called micro darts), which are tiny points that gently penetrate the skin to deliver ingredients deeper.
Size: No two pimples are exactly alike, so different sized and shaped patches will help you target different types of breakouts. A larger sticker can tackle a cluster of pimples, while a little circle is a good choice for a small whitehead.
The best pimple patches of October 2023

We consulted three New York-based dermatologists about their top pimple patch recommendations, plus considered options that earned high ratings from Select staff members and reviewers who have used them.

ZitSticka Killa Kit

Both King and Markowitz recommend Zitsticka patches, which come with priming cleaning swabs to use before applying the patch. "I like that they have micro darts filled with salicylic acid, niacinamide and oligopeptide-76 to treat pimples," says King. “It enables these ingredients, all of which help reduce acne, to really get in there.” They also contain hyaluronic acid, which balances out the potential drying effect of salicylic acid so your zit doesn’t start to flake and scab as it heals, according to Markowitz.

King is also a fan of these pimple patches, which are available in packs of 20 and 60. The patches combine hydrocolloid and salicylic acid to help remove oil and debris from clogged pores. They also contain aloe vera leaf extract, which has anti-inflammatory properties that help soothe and calm redness, according to King.

These highly-rated acne patches are ideal for dry or sensitive skin since they skip potentially drying agents, like salicylic acid. The translucent, hydrocolloid patches come in three sizes — 7mm, 10mm and 12mm, which you can use as needed to cover a single small zit or a cluster. "The smallest is one of the smallest options I've seen, and they are also thinner than most hydrocolloid patches — so this makes them easier to wear without it being obvious,” says King. To use these cleanse your skin first, apply the patch and then remove after eight hours, according to the brand.

Dr. Jart+ Focuspot Micro Tip Blemish Patches

Markowitz is a fan of these acne patches, which use ingredients like niacinamide and antioxidant-rich turmeric, to help soothe very inflamed pimples. Dr. Jart offers two types of pimple patches: a blemish option, which uses vitamin B3 to help clear breakouts and hyaluronic acid for hydration and a dark spot option, which relies on vitamin C to help fade discoloration, according to the brand. The latter is great for darker skin tones, who tend to be left with dark spots as acne heals, says Markowitz.

These patches are another favorite of King’s because of its ingredients: they have salicylic acid and hyaluronic acid to hydrate the skin, plus niacinamide, which can help improve skin tone and texture. Select’s associate updates editor, Zoe Malin, is a fan of because of how thin they are. “They are practically invisible when you put them on,” she says. “So you can totally wear them during the day when working from home — I doubt anyone would be able to tell you were wearing them on a video call.”

“The patches are very effective at extracting a pimple, but it may take a couple rounds of patches depending on how deep or large of a pimple it is,” says Select’s editorial projects associate Rebecca Rodriguez, who tried them for Select’s Wellness Awards. “I like that they’re a little more translucent than other patches I have tried because they blend well with my skin tone and don’t scream ‘hey I’ve got a pimple.’” Unlike other patches that have additional acne-fighting ingredients, these solely rely on the hydrocolloid gel to draw out any sebum or debris from your skin, which makes them gentle for sensitive skin.

Cosrx Pimple Patches

King likes these because each package contains small, medium and large hydrocolloid bandages, giving you options for pimples of different sizes. These Cosrx patches rely solely on hydrocolloid gel to remove excess oil so they’re an ideal option for anyone with sensitive skin because there are no additional ingredients to irritate you, according to King. These are also one of the most consistently highly rated options on our list with an average 4.5-star rating from 32,129 reviews on Amazon.

Starface Hydro Stars

These fragrance-free, star-shaped patches add a little fun to your acne-fighting journey. “Getting a pimple can be such a bummer,” says contributing editor Bethany Heitman. “These bright yellow stars add an element of fun to the entire experience. Because of the shape, I found they were best for smaller zits. I mostly wear them at home. But, I did wear a few to a recent Taylor Swift concert — they covered my breakout and felt festive.” A 100% hydrocolloid option, Markowitz also says they are helpful for reducing zit-related inflammation on sensitive skin.

Another 100% hydrocolloid option, these patches from Nexcare come in a pack of 36 or 108 patches and are another favorite of Markowitz’s. Like the Mighty Patch option from Hero Cosmetics, these turn white once any oily secretion is absorbed, according to the brand. Do not combine these patches with other acne medications or treatments though, according to Nexcare.

These round, unscented patches, which have a 4.3-star average rating from 72,888 reviews on Amazon, contain tea tree oil to help shrink pimples. They’re also infused with calendula, which is known to soothe irritation, according to the brand. In the packet, you’ll get 40 patches in small, medium and large sizes.

How to shop for pimple patches

Picking the best option is all about considering your skin’s specific needs. Simple hydrocolloid patches are ideal for sensitive skin, says Glodny. If you don’t have sensitive skin, you can consider patches that either have micro darts (little points that help ingredients get deeper into a zit by creating small pricks in the skin) or the following acne-fighting ingredients:

Salicylic acid is a beta hydroxy acid that can help unclog pores or remove excess sebum. Patches containing salicylic acid could be a good option for a fairly inflamed pimple, but may irritate dryer, sensitive skin.
Tea tree oil or tea tree extract can be very drying, says Markowitz. This makes it a great tool for drying out pimples. However, if you have dry or sensitive skin, it’s probably best to skip it.
Hyaluronic acid is often paired with other, more drying ingredients like salicylic acid. That’s because it helps to hydrate the skin and can prevent drying caused by other ingredients associated with fighting acne, says King.
Niacinamide is another great addition to a pimple patch because it can improve skin tone and texture, according to King. “Plus, it has stabilizing effects on the skin’s barrier function, which can help improve moisture retention.”


Frequently asked questions
Can pimple patches make acne worse?

As long as you're not allergic or sensitive to an ingredient found in the patches, pimple patches should not make acne worse, according to our experts. As mentioned, patches with salicylic acid or tea tree oil can be more irritating — if you have sensitive skin, skip patches with these ingredients in them.

Worried peeling the patch off will hurt or cause damage? Don’t be. Pimple patches aren’t like bandages for cuts or wounds. The hydrocolloid gel makes them less sticky, so they gently sit on top of your pimple and then easily (and gently) peel off when you’re ready. In fact, they can actually prevent scarring. These patches prevent you from picking at your blemish or trying to pop it on your own, which is what can lead to scarring and hyperpigmentation, says Glodny.

When are pimple patches most effective?

Pimple patches can be very effective on mild breakouts and superficial pimples like small whiteheads and pustules that are just popping up or that recently came to a head, says King. They can also work on cystic acne . “This type of acne sits deeper underneath the skin, making it more challenging for acne-fighting ingredients to get to,” says Glodny. “The prolonged contact that a pimple patch has (you usually keep them on for six to eight hours) means that the ingredients have time to really penetrate.” However, deeper pimples may require multiple nights of treatment with a pimple patch before they’re fully gone.

Another pro of over-the-counter pimple patches is that hydrocolloid patches generally don't dehydrate your skin or leave it flaky, compared to more harsh acne spot treatments featuring salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, according to King. She adds that pimple patches are most effective on sensitive skin and mild acne patients, although those with oily, combination, normal and even dry skin can also use them and see results.

How do you apply a pimple patch?

To avoid transferring bacteria to your pimple, wash your hands before applying a patch. Make sure your skin is clean and dry as well and skip any spot treatment creams, according to Glodny. By doubling up, you risk irritation or drying out your skin, plus, the patch won’t stay put if your skin is sticky with cream.

To adhere the patch to your pimple, peel it off the sheet and center it over your zit. Press down gently and it will stick to your skin. Then, if you need to apply other face products (like moisturizer or makeup), just avoid the area directly around the sticker, according to our experts.

Pimple patches have experienced something of a renaissance in recent years. Not only did the you-know-what tune us into our skin on a deeper level, but the brightly colored stickers from Starface made it cool for post-pubescent adults to rock face décor out in public. And why not? Acne befalls everyone, and as Julie Schott (the brains behind those starry patches) once mused, a change in attitude makes all the difference when combating pimples. There’s a bit more to these zit stickers than being adorable, so we spoke to dermatologists to find out exactly what sets a good pimple patch apart from a great one.

What are the benefits of using a pimple patch?

The most obvious benefit of using a pimple patch is preventing you from picking at your acne. Popping, squeezing, and general fussing can exacerbate breakouts and worsen post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. But they work on a deeper level, too. “[Pimple patches] deliver direct levels of anti-inflammatory ingredients to quickly decrease redness and swelling,” says Rachel Nazarian, M.D., board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology Group in New York City. She says they often contain ingredients that expedite wound healing and dry up any oozing, effectively speeding up the lifecycle of a pimple. On top of that, Dr. Nazarian says a pimple patch’s occlusive properties lead to enhanced delivery of topical ingredients and stimulate healing, with general improvement taking place anywhere from 24 to 48 hours.

What ingredients should you look for in a pimple patch?

The classic pimple patch is usually a simple hydrocolloid dressing, which tends to be used over whiteheads and wider breakouts. Dustin Portela, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist and dermatologic surgeon at Treasure Valley Dermatology in Boise, Idaho says hydrocolloid patches are one of his favorite ways to help heal skin, as they create an ideal (undisturbed, breathable, and moist-in-a-good-way) environment for self-repair.

For hormonal or cystic acne, you may want to reach for a hydrocolloid infused with something a little stronger. “Some of my favorite [ingredients] are salicylic acid, which directly helps fight acne, and niacinamide or arbutin, which can help brighten the skin and fight post-acne dark marks,” says Dr. Portela. He adds that pimple patches with those extra-slim microneedles can be helpful in delivering beneficial ingredients to acne at a slightly deeper level.

When should you use a pimple patch?

“It is totally fine to apply pimple patches to all zits, large and small,” says Dr. Portela. “I recommend using a pimple patch even if you have popped the pimple.” As far as when to use it in your routine, Dr. Nazarian notes: “Ideally, it would be applied as last in your skin care regimen, either in the morning or in the evening while you sleep.”

The One That Justin ‘Pimples Are In’ Bieber Swears By
Starface Hydro-Stars Starter Pack (32-Count)
$15

You know a good pimple patch when you see it on an A-lister, and Starface has proven to be worthy of a myriad of, well, stars. Justin Bieber is perhaps the brand’s best-known champion (and champion of normalizing acne, in general). This is the brand’s starter pack and hero product; the classic yellow stars are clinically proven to minimize pimples by absorbing fluid and reducing inflammation. They’re comprised of one simple thing: hydrocolloid, which is a bandage-like dressing that soothes, heals, and protects the skin. This case holds 32 stars (the pointy ends make it easier to lay flat on any part of the face) plus a handy mirror, but you can opt for the Bieber-loved black color. For something that packs an acne-fighting punch, Starface has blue Hydro-Stars that include salicylic acid.

The Nearly-Invisible One
Peace Out Salicylic Acid Acne Healing Dots
$19

If camouflaging your pimples is the goal, consider these Day Dots from Peace Out your saving grace. You may be familiar with the brand’s classic overnight acne dots, but earlier this year they launched a nearly-invisible one intended for daytime use. Peach Out says these patches are 61% thinner than the originals and are ideal for layering under makeup, or just blurring out a big-time blemish. They contain the skin-loving ingredients you’d expect — including hydrocolloid, aloe vera, and salicylic acid — for fighting breakouts in disguise as well as retinol for post-blemish healing.

ZitSticka Killa Deep-Zit Microdart Acne Patches

The marketing may be aggressive, but it’s not totally overselling the outcome. These “Killa” zit patches are sheathed in micro darts (a euphemism for tiny painless needles) that are intended to penetrate the skin and target those under-the-surface pimples that are in the early stages of plotting a clear-face takeover. As the darts dissolve, they release hallmark acne-fighting ingredients like salicylic acid, niacinamide, and oligopeptide-76, which is meant to interrupt a zit’s progression. Note that this is one of the most expensive options on the list, so you likely want to reserve them for those, especially evil cystic or hormonal breakouts.

COSRX, a Korean skincare line that rose to worldwide fame for its snail mucin products, also makes damn-good acne dots. Dr. Nazarian says these are a great option if you’re in the market for a hydrocolloid patch. They not only prevent picking and prevent bacteria from entering the skin, but also degunkify and absorb excess oil.

Dr. Nazarian recommends combining the protective properties of hydrocolloid with the acne-fighting properties of salicylic acid, specifically via these VitaMedica dots. These have tapered edges so they blend in more seamlessly under makeup and on the skin, and they’re also on the thinner side to lay as flat as possible over breakouts.

Another K-Beauty option, this time from Peach & Lilly’s sister brand. The brand, known for its dewy for the gods skincare also offers a slew of acne-busting dots, but this one’s our favorite. Like the ZitSticka patches, these have painless micro darts that work their magic under the skin to target the biggest and baddest of cystic blemishes. Some ingredients that set these patches apart: centella asiatica extract (a.k.a. “cica”) and tea-tree oil to calm the skin and reduce inflammation.

These Pimple Patches Improve the Look of Breakouts Fast

Think of them as “Band-Aids with superpowers,” say dermatologists.

By Genesis RivasPublished: Jul 25, 2023
SAVE ARTICLE

If you have acne-prone skin, then your skincare routine likely consists of some gold-standard acne fighters: salicylic acid serums, benzoyl peroxide cleansers, possibly a retinol treatment. Another worthy addition? Pimple patches. "They're like Band-Aids with superpowers," says Anar Mikailov, MD, a board-certified dermatologist and cofounder of Skintensive. "The patches are typically made from a hydrocolloid dressing, which is a very soft and spongy material that forms a water-resistant protective layer over the skin. This prevents you from rubbing, picking, or scratching a pimple, causing irritation that can slow healing time and possibly lead to scarring," he says. It also stops you from introducing grime or germs.

Often pimple patches contain acne-fighting ingredients to help heal pimples faster. "They work by absorbing fluid or pus from the pimple, shrinking it in size, and decreasing inflammation," says Kiran Mian, DO, a medical and aesthetic dermatologist. For instance, some patches contain salicylic acid, which helps clear out the acne-causing debris stuck inside pores, explains Mian. Others contain niacinamide to help regulate sebum secretion and reduce swelling and redness, adds Mikailov. You can even find some patches with tiny micro darts that help drive ingredients deeper into the skin.

Bottom line: Pimple patches are a great way to help a breakout heal, but they don't treat the underlying condition."It's important to see your dermatologist if the breakouts are persistent," says Dhaval Bhanusali, MD, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Hudson Dermatology and Laser Surgery. Here, our favorite and dermatologist-recommended options.

Designed with a special edge for more precision and control when placing the patch, when placed accurately at once, it will not fall off itself.\n\nCan I reapply the patch?\n\nThe patch adheres strongly to the skin once placed and adhesion decreases by 70% when peeled off. You can re-apply the patch but it may not adhere as well.\n\nProduct details\nPackage Dimensions \u200f : \u200e 6.69 x 3.78 x 0.75 inches; 1.06 Ounces\nManufacturer \u200f : \u200e FARMSKIN\nASIN \u200f : \u200e B0B5QKH71C\nBest Sellers Rank: #9,104 in Beauty & Personal Care (See Top 100 in Beauty & Personal Care)\n#68 in Pore Cleansing Strips\n#217 in Unique Beauty & Health\nCustomer Reviews:\n4.4 \n4.4 out of 5 stars\n    596 ratings\nVideos\nVideos for this product\n\n0:10\n\n\t\nCustomer Review: Practically invisible patch\n\nMSM\n\n0:20\n\nTroubless Invisible Pimple Spot Patch for Pimples & Acnes\n\nFARMSKIN Inc\n\nVideos for related products\n\n0:33\n\nPimple Stop, Oldam Spot Cover\n\nOldam\n\n0:56\n\n\t\nMy go-to pimple patch!\n\n✅️ Savvy Deals ✅️\n\n1:17\n\n\t\nPimple patches it comes with 180 patches\n\nJulieta Newman\n\nUpload your video\nImportant information\n\nTo report an issue with this product, click here.\n\nLooking for specific info?\nCustomer reviews\n4.4 out of 5 stars\n4.4 out of 5\n596 global ratings\n5 star\t\n\t69%\n4 star\t\n\t14%\n3 star\t\n\t8%\n2 star\t\n\t4%\n1 star\t\n\t5%\nHow customer reviews and ratings work\nReviews with images\nSee all photos\nTop reviews\nMost recent\nTop reviews\nTop reviews from the United States\n\tEzra\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n My favorite\nReviewed in the United States on October 10, 2023\nPattern Name: SignatureVerified Purchase\nThese are the only patches I get.

These are such a deal!\nThey adhere well, without being hard to remove or painful. They have stayed on all day and all night when applied.\nThey do their job and absorb well, and leave me with no blemish or if it’s a big one, it is SO much smaller within 6 hours that it is almost completely gone.\nThese patches are incredibly thin and I even feel confident enough to wear them out of the house with no make up to cover them. That being said, they do absorb so well that what has been absorbed will be noticed after a bit. But the patch itself is thin as can be!\nI do love being able to peel the patch off without having to touch it. It makes application easier and more sanitary.\nThese are ones I will continue to buy!\nOne person found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\n\tsirocco\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Replacement for Rael pimple patch\nReviewed in the United States on October 9, 2023\nPattern Name: SignatureVerified Purchase\nI have found a replacement for Rael acne miracle pimple patch!

If you\'re expecting these to absorb a lot of sebum/gunk from a pimple...these don\'t really do that (at least for me). They\'re pretty good at covering up the blemishes and will slowly decrease the problem size over a few wears. I do like the tab concept. It definitely makes pulling them off the plastic -- avoiding foldover and putting them on a lot easier.\nHelpful\nReport\n\tPearl Estrada\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Almost forgettable that you have it on.\nReviewed in the United States on September 23, 2023\nPattern Name: SignatureVerified Purchase\nCovers blemishes, very absorbant and you forget you even have it on.

If you\'re expecting these to absorb a lot of sebum/gunk from a pimple...these don\'t really do that (at least for me). They\'re pretty good at covering up the blemishes and will slowly decrease the problem size over a few wears. I do like the tab concept. It definitely makes pulling them off the plastic -- avoiding foldover and putting them on a lot easier.\nHelpful\nReport\n\tPearl Estrada\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n Almost forgettable that you have it on.\nReviewed in the United States on September 23, 2023\nPattern Name: SignatureVerified Purchase\nCovers blemishes, very absorbant and you forget you even have it on.

Not only did the you-know-what tune us into our skin on a deeper level, but the brightly colored stickers from Starface made it cool for post-pubescent adults to rock face décor out in public. And why not? Acne befalls everyone, and as Julie Schott (the brains behind those starry patches) once mused, a change in attitude makes all the difference when combating pimples. There’s a bit more to these zit stickers than being adorable, so we spoke to dermatologists to find out exactly what sets a good pimple patch apart from a great one.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using a pimple patch?\n\nThe most obvious benefit of using a pimple patch is preventing you from picking at your acne. Popping, squeezing, and general fussing can exacerbate breakouts and worsen post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. But they work on a deeper level, too. “[Pimple patches] deliver direct levels of anti-inflammatory ingredients to quickly decrease redness and swelling,” says Rachel Nazarian, M.D., board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology Group in New York City. She says they often contain ingredients that expedite wound healing and dry up any oozing, effectively speeding up the lifecycle of a pimple. On top of that, Dr. Nazarian says a pimple patch’s occlusive properties lead to enhanced delivery of topical ingredients and stimulate healing, with general improvement taking place anywhere from 24 to 48 hours.\n\nWhat ingredients should you look for in a pimple patch?\n\nThe classic pimple patch is usually a simple hydrocolloid dressing, which tends to be used over whiteheads and wider breakouts. Dustin Portela, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist and dermatologic surgeon at Treasure Valley Dermatology\xa0in Boise, Idaho says hydrocolloid patches are one of his favorite ways to help heal skin, as they create an ideal (undisturbed, breathable, and moist-in-a-good-way) environment for self-repair.\n\nFor hormonal or cystic acne, you may want to reach for a hydrocolloid infused with something a little stronger. “Some of my favorite [ingredients] are salicylic acid, which directly helps fight acne, and niacinamide or arbutin, which can help brighten the skin and fight post-acne dark marks,” says Dr. Portela. He adds that pimple patches with those extra-slim microneedles can be helpful in delivering beneficial ingredients to acne at a slightly deeper level.\n\nWhen should you use a pimple patch?\n\n“It is totally fine to apply pimple patches to all zits, large and small,” says Dr. Portela. “I recommend using a pimple patch even if you have popped the pimple.” As far as when to use it in your routine, Dr. Nazarian notes: “Ideally, it would be applied as last in your skin care regimen, either in the morning or in the evening while you sleep.”\n\nThe One That Justin ‘Pimples Are In’ Bieber Swears By\nStarface Hydro-Stars Starter Pack (32-Count)\n$15\n\nYou know a good pimple patch when you see it on an A-lister, and Starface has proven to be worthy of a myriad of, well, stars. Justin Bieber is perhaps the brand’s best-known champion (and champion of normalizing acne, in general). This is the brand’s starter pack and hero product; the classic yellow stars are clinically proven to minimize pimples by absorbing fluid and reducing inflammation. They’re comprised of one simple thing: hydrocolloid, which is a bandage-like dressing that soothes, heals, and protects the skin. This case holds 32 stars (the pointy ends make it easier to lay flat on any part of the face) plus a handy mirror, but you can opt for the Bieber-loved black color. For something that packs an acne-fighting punch, Starface has blue Hydro-Stars that include salicylic acid.\n\nHydrocolloid | 32 count | Cost-per-patch: $0.47\xa0\n\n$15 AT AMAZON\n$15 AT WALMART\nThe Nearly-Invisible One\nPeace Out Salicylic Acid Acne Healing Dots\n$19\n\nIf camouflaging your pimples is the goal, consider these Day Dots from Peace Out your saving grace. You may be familiar with the brand’s classic overnight acne dots, but earlier this year they launched a nearly-invisible one intended for daytime use. Peach Out says these patches are 61% thinner than the originals and are ideal for layering under makeup, or just blurring out a big-time blemish. They contain the skin-loving ingredients you’d expect — including hydrocolloid, aloe vera, and salicylic acid —\xa0for fighting breakouts in disguise as well as retinol for post-blemish healing.\n\nHydrocolloid, salicylic acid, retinol, aloe vera | 20 count | Cost-per-patch: $0.95\xa0\n\n$19 AT SEPHORA\n$19 AT ULTA BEAUTY\nThe One for Waging War on Cystic Acne\nZitSticka Killa Deep-Zit Microdart Acne Patches\n$29 for 8\n\nThe marketing may be aggressive, but it’s not totally overselling the outcome. These “Killa” zit patches are sheathed in micro darts (a euphemism for tiny painless needles) that are intended to penetrate the skin and target those under-the-surface pimples that are in the early stages of plotting a clear-face takeover. As the darts dissolve, they release hallmark acne-fighting ingredients like salicylic acid, niacinamide, and oligopeptide-76, which is meant to interrupt a zit’s progression. Note that this is one of the most expensive options on the list, so you likely want to reserve them for those, especially evil cystic or hormonal breakouts.\n\nHydrocolloid, salicylic acid, niacinamide, peptide complex, hyaluronic acid | 8 count | Cost-per-patch: $3.63\xa0\n\n\n$29 FOR 8 AT AMAZON\n$29 FOR 8 AT ULTA BEAUTY\nThe One for Big Ass Blemishes\nRael Beauty Miracle Acne Patch Spot Control Cover - 10 Count\n$12\n\nWhen you’ve got acne here, there, everywhere —\xa0or just one unbelievably massive (and, likely, painful) zit —\xa0you’ll want to reach for one of these oversized Rael patches. The larger patch will prevent you from picking and exacerbating any sized pimple. Mark our words: future you will be grateful.\n\nHydrocolloid | 10 count | Cost-per-patch: $1.20\n\n$12 AT NORDSTROM\n$12 AT REVOLVE CLOTHING\nThe Derm-Backed Hydrocolloid Patch\nCOSRX Pimple Master Patch Set - 90 Count\n$13 for 96\n\nCOSRX, a Korean skincare line that rose to worldwide fame for its snail mucin products, also makes damn-good acne dots. Dr. Nazarian says these are a great option if you’re in the market for a hydrocolloid patch. They not only prevent picking and prevent bacteria from entering the skin, but also degunkify and absorb excess oil.\n\nHydrocolloid | 90 count | Cost-per-patch: $0.21\n\n$13 FOR 96 AT AMAZON\n$15 FOR 96 AT WALMART\nThe Derm-Backed Salicylic Acid Patch\nVitaMedica Clear Skin Spot Dots\n$15\n\nDr. Nazarian recommends combining the protective properties of hydrocolloid with the acne-fighting properties of salicylic acid, specifically via these VitaMedica dots. These have tapered edges so they blend in more seamlessly under makeup and on the skin, and they’re also on the thinner side to lay as flat as possible over breakouts.\n\nHydrocolloid, salicylic acid | 24 count | Cost-per-patch: $0.58\n\n$15 AT AMAZON\nFROM $14 AT VITAMEDICA\nThe One for Whiteheads\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Original Acne Patches\n$10 for 36\n$12 now 20% off\n\nA whitehead’s siren song is hard to ignore. They just need a little push, no? Avoid the unnecessary open wound and subsequent scaring, from your moment of weakness with these best-selling patches from Hero Cosmetics. One of the brands to first help demystify the magic of pimple patches, these have one simple rule: put the patch on and peel it off when it turns white.\n\nHydrocolloid | 36 count | Cost-per-patch: $0.33\n\n$10 FOR 36 AT AMAZON\n$13 FOR 36 AT ULTA BEAUTY\nThe One for Deep Pimples\nPeach Slices Deep Blemish Microdarts\n$9\n\nAnother K-Beauty option, this time from Peach & Lilly’s sister brand. The brand, known for its dewy for the gods skincare also offers a slew of acne-busting dots, but this one’s our favorite. Like the ZitSticka patches, these have painless micro darts that work their magic under the skin to target the biggest and baddest of cystic blemishes. Some ingredients that set these patches apart: centella asiatica extract (a.k.a. “cica”) and tea-tree oil to calm the skin and reduce inflammation.\n\nSalicylic acid, niacinamide, centella asiatica extract, tea tree oil | 9 count | Cost-per-patch: $1\n\n$9 AT AMAZON\n$9 AT ULTA BEAUTY\nThe One That’s Fit for a dELiA*s Catalog\nFlorence by Mills Spot A Spot Acne Patches\n$15\n\nBreakouts don’t age-discriminate (hello, adult-onset acne), and while these patches appear to be marketed for whatever group of youths come after Gen-Z, they’re perfect for whomsoever prefers a fun-over-fuss approach to healing their zits. In one pack of these Florence by Mills packages, you’ll find dolphins, butterflies, and clouds that will not so much hide your acne as shout that you have them from the stratum corneum (the epidermis’ proverbial rooftop).\n\nHydrocolloid, salicylic acid, tea tree oil | 36 count | Cost-per-patch: $0.42\n\n$15 AT AMAZON\n$15 AT ULTA BEAUTY\nThe Clinically-Tested One\nNeutrogena Stubborn Acne Ultra-Thin Blemish Patches\n$8\n\nNot all beauty products are clinically tested, but when it comes to acne-oriented ingredients, the science of it all is important. These affordable patches from Neutrogena use the classic blemish-minimizing powers of hydrocolloids and have the studies to prove it. According to the brand, over 90% of participants reported flatter-looking pimples the next day.\n\nHydrocolloid | 24 count | Cost-per-patch: $0.38\n\n$8 AT AMAZON\n$8 AT NEUTROGENA\nThe All-in-One Pack\nPatchology Breakout Box Blemish Treatment\n$20\n\nFor those with breakouts that just won’t quit or prep for a big event, this three-part Patchology acne dot set has everything you need to keep your bathroom stocked in case of acne emergency.

Now, if you notice an angry zit developing, you pop on a pimple patch for a few hours and the sticker will suck the nastiness out of your skin. Each week, it seems that another new pimple patch has entered the market, so we spoke to skin-care experts — including board-certified dermatologists and our resident beauty writer — to find out what to look for in a pimple patch and which ones are the best. But before reading on, take stock of the one piece of advice all of our experts were unanimous about: Stop picking your pimples!\n\nWhat we’re looking for\nIngredients\n\nHydrocolloid — a fluid-absorbing gel — is the ingredient in most pimple patches. “Hydrocolloids are wound dressings that have been used for decades on the skin for chronic ulcers, trauma wounds, and even burns,” says Dr. Jamie Glick, a dermatologist at New York Dermatology Group. You may have already used a hydrocolloid patch to treat a blister or small wound, and the process with pimple patches is the same: They draw out any excess oil and gunk. The patches also help acne blemishes to heal by acting as a physical barrier, keeping out bacteria and stopping you from picking. “Long before I was a dermatologist, my mother used to say, ‘Touching a pimple is like watering a plant — it will grow and grow,’” Glick says. “I use that phrase all the time with my patients and recommend acne patches especially to my patients who are pickers.”\n\nSome other common ingredients in pimple patches include active acne-treating topicals like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and tea-tree oil. But Dr. Amy Perlmutter, also of the New York Dermatology Group, recommends “sticking with the hydrocolloid-only patches unless evaluated by a dermatologist and instructed otherwise. This is because patches with active acne-fighting ingredients have the potential to irritate and/or dry out the skin.” If your skin is sensitive, that’s an even higher risk for you.\n\nAppearance\n\nThe majority of pimple patches are designed to look as imperceptible as possible, so in theory, you can pop one on and head out without it being super-obvious. Most of the patches on this list, then, are small, thin, transparent dots, making them hard to spot on any skin tone. But that’s not always the case. I’ve outlined what each patch looks like and what sizes they come in to best suit your needs.\n\nPrice\n\nBeneath each pack, I’ve made a note of the price per patch.\n\nBest patches overall\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Original Acne Patches\n$12 now 20% off\n$10 for 36\n\nIngredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dot, one size (12 mm) | Price: $0.36 per patch\n\nDr. Perlmutter recommends these patches from Hero Cosmetics. They contain medical-grade hydrocolloid to remove excess fluid and oils from blemishes, but she says they also “maintain optimum PH level and temperature, which helps prevent bacterial overgrowth and promote healing.” Mighty Patches take about six to eight hours to work, so they are a great option to use overnight. Any oil sucked out turns white on the transparent patch, so you can really see the benefit. These patches contain only hydrocolloid, so they shouldn’t dry out sensitive skin. They’re also transparent — turning slightly opaque once they’re finished — so look subtle on a variety of skin tones. Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Margarita Lolis also finds that as the patches are matte, they blend in well if you’re layering foundation over them. They’re also great value for money.\n\n$10 FOR 36 AT AMAZON\n$13 FOR 36 AT HERO COSMETICS\nBest less-expensive patches\nThe Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch\n$6\n\nIngredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dot, mix of medium (10 mm) and large (14 mm) | Price: $0.14\n\nAt $6 for 42 patches —\xa0or just $0.14 per sticker — the Klog patches are amazing value. “The patch is thinner and almost clear, which helps it camouflage better into most skin tones,” says Carmen Castilla, M.D., who also appreciates the mix of patch sizes for different-size pimples. “Hydrocolloid patches are also unlikely to cause irritation, so they work well even on those with more sensitive skin types,” she says.\n\n$6 AT SOKO GLAM\nBest patches for whiteheads\nCOSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch\n$6 for 24\n\nIngredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dot, mix of small (7 mm), medium (10 mm) and large (12 mm) | Price: $0.25 per patch\n\n“Cosrx Pimple Patches are the holy grail. Drop everything and buy them,” says Strategist beauty writer Rio Viera-Newton. She recommended these patches in her original skin-care Google doc and thinks that they work best for extracting every last bit of gunk from whiteheads. “If you pop or pick a zit, put this on immediately afterward, go to bed, and in the morning, you’ll see what I’m talking about and thank me.” And while we’re not recommending picking, hey — we know it happens.\n\n$6 FOR 24 AT DERMSTORE\nBest patches for body acne\nNeutrogena Stubborn Acne Ultra-Thin Blemish Patches\n$8\n\nIngredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dots or triangles, exact size not listed | Price: $0.33 per patch\n\nDr. Perlmutter also likes these ultrathin options from Neutrogena, which are more discreet when applied. They’re available in either dot or triangle shapes, with the latter specifically designed for angling on the side of your nose or for treating larger breakouts on the back or the chest. Containing just hydrocolloid, they’re nondrying and nonirritating.\n\n$8 AT AMAZON\n$8 AT TARGET\nBest almost invisible patches\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Invisible+\n$18 now 22% off\n$14\n\nIngredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Ultra-thin transparent dots, mix of small (10 mm) and medium (12 mm) | Price: $0.46 per patch\n\nThese patches, another by Mighty Patch, are a favorite of both Dr. Shereene Idriss, a board-certified dermatologist, and Viera-Newton. They’re great because they’re “super-ultrathin, so you can barely see them — sometimes I even lose track of where I’ve put them when I look in the mirror,” says Viera-Newton. “On days where I have a really bad zit and want it to be protected from the horrible grime of the city, I use these. I’ve even thrown some concealer on top of it to further disguise it.” Again, they contain only hydrocolloid, so they are kind to sensitive skin.\n\n$14 AT AMAZON\n$18 AT HERO COSMETICS\nBest colorful patches\nStarface Hydro-Stars Starter Pack (32-Count)\n$15\n\nIngredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Neon yellow stars, 12 mm | Price: $0.46 per patch\n\nDr Idriss, Viera-Newton, and Dr. Perlmutter each recommend these fun pimple patches (that you’re sure to have seen on your feed at least once.) Each one is shaped like a star and uses hydrocolloid to draw out oil and gunk from pimples. They inject a bit of whimsy into not picking away at your face all day — at an affordable price point.\n\n$15 AT AMAZON\n$15 AT STARFACE\nBest colorful patches with darts\nStarface Micro-cloud\n$18\n\nIngredients: Hydrocolloid, niacinamide, and salicylic acid | Appearance: Baby-blue clouds, 12 mm. | Price: $1.50 per patch\n\n“The blue cloud patch is fun if you are not trying to camouflage the fact you have a pimple patch on,” says Dr. Castilla. But these cloud-shaped patches differ from the original Starface patches beyond just the look, says dermatologist Dr. Kristina Collins. In addition to hydrocolloid, they have darts that contain niacinamide and salicylic acid. The hydrocolloid dressing protects the affected area from dirt and will also help absorb pus and oil away from the skin, while the salicylic acid helps increase cell turnover and dissolve any dead skin cells clogging the pores. Niacinamide then helps to reduce inflammation.\n\nThe patches are ideal for targeting cystic pimples in the early stages. If you feel the signature aching of a gnarly under-the-skin pimple, that’s the ideal time to press one on. However, as the additional ingredients may cause irritation, neither doctor recommends these patches to those with sensitive skin, instead pointing patients back toward the original Starface patches.\n\n$18 AT STARFACE\nBest patches for larger spots\nAcropass Trouble Cure\n$18\n\nIngredients: Tea tree, salicylic acid, hyaluronic acid | Appearance: Transparent dots, one size (not listed) | Price: $3 per treatment (a wipe and a patch)\n\nThe Acropass Trouble Cure is actually a two-step process involving a wipe that treats your skin before you apply the patch. The wipe pairs acne-fighting tea-tree oil and salicylic acid, which can dry the skin, but the patch adds moisture back. “The Acropass has teeny-tiny microneedles infused with hyaluronic acid, an ingredient that deeply hydrates the skin, and niacinamide, a form of vitamin B3, which has brightening and soothing effects,” explains Viera-Newton. “The microneedles — which, I know, sound scary — are so thin you can barely feel them, and they puncture the zit to attack it from the inside out.” After testing them on a few different types of blemish, Viera-Newton says these work best on large, intimidating, unpoppable spots.\n\n$18 AT SOKO GLAM\nBest patches for hormonal acne\nZitSticka Killa Kit 8-Pack\n$29\n\nIngredients: Salicylic acid, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid | Appearance: Transparent dots (one size, not listed) | Price: $3.62 per patch\n\n“Into adulthood, I’ve still been plagued with monthly flare-ups of hormonal cysts on my chin. Like clockwork, the deep, painful, under-the-skin growths erupt to trumpet the arrival of my period,” says Strategist writer Dominique Pariso. After testing a few pimple patches and getting nowhere, she decided to try the multistep patches from ZitSticka. They work in a similar way to the Acropass patches — micro-darts push salicylic acid, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid into the skin. But the ZitSticka patches also have a hydrocolloid top layer, meaning they can fight acne before it develops. “The first time I slapped the patches on before bed, I woke up to find that the monster welts lurking beneath my face were flatter, calmer, and less red than they had been the night before,” says Pariso, whose cysts now clear up in a couple of days as opposed to a couple of weeks.\n\n$29 AT AMAZON\nBest easy-to-apply patches\nBioré Cover & Conquer Blemish Patches\n$12\n\nIngredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dots, 15 mm. | Price: $0.40 per patch\n\n“Bioré patches feature perforated packaging, which makes it easier to get the pimple patch off without bending the corners,” says Dr. Castilla. That’s important because “if the corners are bent, the pimple patch is more visible and doesn’t stick as well. It also allows you to put the patch on without touching the part that will lay on your skin, meaning the patch itself stays clean.” As the Bioré patches are just hydrocolloid, without any active ingredients, they’re suitable for even sensitive skin, but the patches do only come in one size, so they’re not the best option if you want a wide variety.\n\n$12 AT AMAZON\nSome other products to combat breakouts\nOur favorite drugstore cleanser\n$8\n$8 AT WALMART\n$8 AT NEUTROGENA\nAn oil-free water-based moisturizer\n$15\n$27 now 44% off\n$15 AT AMAZON\n$20 AT TARGET\nAn oil to treat existing acne scars (and prevent new ones)\n$74\nBUY AT SEPHORA\nOur experts\n\n• Dr. Carmen Castilla, board-certified dermatologist at New York Dermatology Group and clinical instructor at Mount Sinai Hospital\n• Dr. Kristina Collins, board-certified dermatologist\n• Dr. Jamie Glick, dermatologist at NY Dermatology Group\n• Dr. Shereene Idriss, board Certified Dermatologist\n• Dr. Margarita Lolis, board-certified dermatologist\n• Dominique Pariso, Strategist writer\n• Dr. Amy Perlmutter, dermatologist at NY Dermatology Group\n• Rio Viera-Newton, Strategist beauty writer\n\nGET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER\nActually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.\nEmail\n \n\nThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.

A cult-favorite box of Mighty Patch Original hydrocolloid patches with 42,000+ 5-star reviews claiming these things are actual magic.\namazon.com, amazon.com\n\nBy the way, hydrocolloid patches are most effective at treating acne that has already come to the surface (aka when you can see a whitehead). Once it\'s reached that stage, the patch can pull out any fluid, dead skin, bacteria, or whatever else is hiding in there way more easily than if there are multiple layers of skin over the pimple.\n\nWe also gave these pimple patches a shoutout in "21 In-Flight Beauty Products Perfect For Your Next Plane Ride."\n\nPromising review: "Witchcraft? I do not claim to understand the science behind these tiny miracles, but they have changed my life. I spent my workday looking forward to going home and putting one of these bad boys on my newly erupted Mt. Zit and the overnight results were shocking. Not only is it grossly satisfying, but it saved me several days of walking around with a bloody crater in my face because my previous method of dealing with unsightly blemishes was to pick pick pick." —Adg\n\nGet 36 patches from Amazon for $12.99.\n\nAdd to Wishlist\n2.

I wore it overnight while I slept and when I woke up I took it off and was amazed! No blemish – just a huge white blob on the patch! I also applied one to my nose to see what would come out and there was so much oil and tiny whiteheads on the strip!

We love an overachiever.\namazon.com, amazon.com\n\nPromising review: "Like most acne products, I was afraid they would be too drying or just not work. I was so surprised! They reduced the appearance (redness/swelling) of acne and also helped it heal considerably faster! Not only did they work great on the acne, but the skin they were applied to was visibly better/healthier looking than the untreated area! Not only was the skin NOT dried out, but it appeared more moisturized and pores were even less visible! They are a nice neutral, blending color. I love that you get three sizes and 120 in a pack! It absolutely makes it worth the price! I think the magic ingredient that puts these way above the competitors is hyaluronic acid. Instead of just drying your pimple/skin out, the HA keeps your skin moisturized and looking great! I\'m now a customer for life! Try these! You won\'t be disappointed! :-)" —Courtney\n\n\nGet 120 patches from Amazon for $18.99.\n\nAdd to Wishlist\n4.

I was seriously shocked. And for after just one overnight use! I continued putting patches on it and the spot on my face is healed after just a couple of days. These patches have worked wonderfully on my less severe zits, as well. They’ve taken redness away and the zits just start to heal instead of needing to come to a head and be popped. Try these!

All the \'goo\' had been sucked out of my skin onto the patch and just a tiny speckle remained. The pimple was gone by the next day. It didn\'t hang around for days, giving me opportunities to poke and prod it and cause scarring. These are even good for when you can just feel a pimple about to pop up, use one preemptively for a couple of nights, and it doesn\'t even let the thing turn into an actual zit. I\'ve tried a few other brands but the Alba are my favorite. They\'re priced well, you get a lot of patches, different sized patches, they work well, and they have salicylic acid." —Molly D\n\nGet 40 patches from Amazon for $7.97.\n\nAdd to Wishlist\nADVERTISEMENT\n7.

I wore them to bed again that night and woke up the next morning to find that for the first time in months, my skin appeared to be healing. I was so excited that I actually almost cried. I was so encouraged that I put more patches on and wore them around the house for the rest of the day and evening, and I am not kidding when I tell you that I took them off before bed to find that my acne, which had completely withstood the test of every dermatologist recommendation for months, was all but gone.

I was desperate to find something to help cover and heal my acne, especially since I work in customer service and I am interacting with people all day long so I need to feel my best and most confident. I have a nasty habit of touching my acne and making it worse and this product helps protect my skin from that. It is virtually unnoticeable and most people do not see it unless I pointed it out. I will say that the 12-mm patches are more noticeable than the 10 mm patches. However, they are still very hard to see. When they are in a spot that moves a lot, such as around your mouth or in between your eyebrows, I do notice that the patch can wrinkle a little bit. But I am also wearing them for my 8+ hour shifts so that is to be expected. Taking off the patch is incredibly satisfying. It does pull out impurities and toxins...you can really tell that it was absorbing and pulling out toxins." —Berit K. Thompson\n\nGet 39 patches from Amazon for $17.99.\n\nAdd to Wishlist\n13.

I was hesitant to try it out at first when my sister recommended it to me, but whatever doubts I had for sticky patches to magically remove pimples were proven wrong when I tried it. The patches work in hours, sometimes even instantly (depending on how raised the pimple is), sucking out all the pus of a whitehead or soothing down a red bump overnight. They\'re perfect to use especially when you\'re under time constraints (for an interview or occasion)! The best thing is that as soon as you clean up the spot where you removed it, it barely leaves any dark spots or traces behind a few days later. I appreciate this because I have an issue with hyperpigmentation, but I don\'t need to worry about it much with these patches.10/10 recommend!" —Hadeer Leila\n\nGet it from Amazon for $9.97.\n\nAdd to Wishlist\nADVERTISEMENT\n18. A multipack of COSRX\'s Acne Pimple Master Patch so you can delegate all that pimple-popping work to the patches.\namazon.com, Amazon\n\nPromising review: "These little dots of magic work some kind of voodoo to remove those big, erupting volcano pimples, the tiny little extremely painful ones, and the dreaded blind pimple. These little tabs are clear and painless. They come in different sizes and are barely noticeable when worn. They also stay in place really well. I’ve even left one on during a shower and it didn’t budge. The best results happen overnight. You put one on overnight and by morning the blemish is smaller, less red, and less painful. There’s no peeling or burning since it doesn’t contain salicylic acid. You’ll notice a \'center\' start to form on the dot that is white or cloudy and that’s how you know it’s doing its job. That center is the goopy stuff being drawn from the offending blemish. Mysteriously, the area that was a pimple won’t have a scab or watery ooziness or even a \'head.\' It will just be a mini version of its former self. Clean your face, put a fresh patch on, and the next morning it’s gone." —Darci\n\nGet three packs of 24 patches from Amazon for $35.\n\nAdd to Wishlist\n19. A box of PanOxyl PM Overnight Spot Patches that\'ll absorb pus and fluids while you\'re sleeping so you can wake up and geek out over how much your skin healed ~overnight~.\nAmazon\n\nBe sure to check out out recommendations for other acne-fighting products!\n\nPromising review: "These are the best acne spot patches I’ve used, and I’ve tried many! I get huge, painful cystic acne and one popped up on my neck that was just so gross and couldn’t be hidden. By the end of the first day, the cyst had shrunk in size by at least 50%. By the end of day two, it had formed a head and burst on its own. By the end of day three, the cyst was completely drained and flat, and the only visible sign of it was a small scab. But on day two of neck zit, I noticed another smaller pimple coming up on my chin. I wore the patches overnight and by the morning it had completely come to the surface rather than stewing under the skin for days. By the end of day two, it popped, and by the end of day three, it’s gone. These will definitely stay stockpiled in my home from now on!" —amanda\n\nGet 40 patches from Amazon for $6.79.\n\nAdd to Wishlist\nADVERTISEMENT\n20.

They stick well and don\'t peel off, and they draw out fluid and soothe my skin." –Katie S.\n\n\nGet 36 patches from Florence By Mills for $14.\n\nAdd to Wishlist\n21.

They stick to my skin well and get rid of my acne. They’re so cute I don’t have a problem wearing them out. Sometimes for a more stubborn zit I have to use a couple to get rid of it but I don’t mind because it’s better than me scratching at it.

JUST CRAZY. UPDATED JAN. 4, 2023\nThe Best Patch for Every Kind of Pimple\nBy Rio Viera-Newton, a beauty columnist at the Strategist and author of Let\'s Face It.\nThe author, applying her Cosrx patch. Photo: Courtesy of Rio Viera Newton.\n\nWhen it comes to preventing future breakouts, ingredients like tretinoin, benzoyl peroxide, and azelaic acid are your dermatologist-approved best bet. But as far as treating active acne goes, in my humble opinion, there are few products as efficacious and quite frankly satisfying as the glorious pimple patch.\n\nGenerally, pimple patches are circular, hydrocolloid, Band-Aid-esque spot treatments that work by absorbing drainage (such as pus and the clear liquid that sometimes oozes out)\xa0from your zit while simultaneously covering the area to protect the inflamed skin. When in doubt, slap a pimple patch on the breakout and you’ll most likely wake to a flatter, smaller, and all-around less angry pimple.\n\nWhen I first got into skin care, there were only a handful of pimple patches on the market. But these days, there are endless options in various sizes and formulas. Below, a list of my favorite pimple patches along with when and where to use them.\n\nFor standard whiteheads\nCOSRX Pimple Master Patch Set - 90 Count\n$15 for 96\n\nIf you wake up with a standard whitehead, apply your standard, 100 percent hydrocolloid pimple patch. This simple patch will help draw the pus from the blemish so that by the time you remove it, the area will be much flatter and less noticeable.\n\n$15 FOR 96 AT WALMART\n$19 AT ULTA BEAUTY\nFor deep, mean cystic pimples\nAcropass Trouble Cure\n$18\n\nLet’s say you have one of those deep, under-the-skin, painful pimples that simply won’t go away. In this instance, a standard pimple patch likely won’t do much — sure,\xa0it might be able to protect the area and prevent you from picking, but with a super-under-the-skin spot, a standard pimple patch isn’t going to penetrate or absorb anything. For these meanies, micro darts are your best bet for effectively delivering treatment in to the blemish and shrinking it down.\n\nThese patches from Acropass are a two-step system: First, you wipe the area with a pad drenched in anti-inflammatory and antibacterial salicylic acid and tea-tree oil to help treat the pimple on the surface. Then apply the pimple patch itself. But this is no standard pimple patch: It’s coated in teeny-tiny crystal micro-darts made up of hyaluronic acid and niacinamide that treat the cyst.\n\nThis product is quite polarizing: It works wonders for some and doesn’t do much for others. But from my own experience, I can say this has helped me out with my angriest, deepest cystic pimples.\n\n$18 AT SOKO GLAM\nFor “I dont know what this bump is” pimples\nPURITO All Care Recovery Cica-Aid Patches - 51 Count\n$9\n\nIt happens to the best of us: You look in the mirror and come across a zit, but you don’t exactly know what kind of zit it is. It doesn’t have a whitehead, but it’s not quite big enough to be a full-on cyst (plus, you don’t want to waste one of your precious Acropass patches on it because they’re not cheap!) In these instances, Purito’s All Care Recovery Cica-Aid is an excellent choice. The hydrocolloid patch is infused with centella asiatica, an ultrasoothing ingredient that helps reduce swelling and redness. It won’t irritate the area, and whatever the zit might be, the centella’s calming benefits are bound to help.\n\n$9 AT AMAZON\nFor cute coverage of standard pimples\nSquish Flower Power Acne Patches\n$14\nBUY AT AMAZON\n$14 AT NORDSTROM\nStarface Hydro-Stars Party Pack - Big Pack, 96 Count\n$27\nBUY AT AMAZON\n\nAdorable options are, in my opinion, one of the greatest innovations in the pimple patch space. Beloved by many celebrities — Justin and Hailey Bieber as well as Dua Lipa are just a few that have sported them outside the house — these cute little sticker-esque patches are darling enough to wear all day so you can treat and protect your pimples on the go. These are also particularly great for people who have picking tendencies. With these on all day, you can curb your urge to poke and prod.\n\nFor pimple clusters and larger areas\nRael Beauty Miracle Acne Patch Spot Control Cover - 10 Count\n$12\n$13 now 8% off\n\nIf you’re dealing with multiple pimples in one area — this sometimes happens to me along my chin or jawline — these large hydrocolloid strips are super-handy. They’re flexible, adhere to the skin really well, and allow you to treat the whole area without having to use tons of your standard patches.\n\n$12 AT AMAZON\n$12 AT NORDSTROM\nFor post-pimple scarring\nZitSticka Hyperfade Dark Spot Microdart Patch - 12 Count\n$34 for 12\n\nAnother micro-dart pimple patch — but it’s specifically formulated for post-acne scarring rather than active spots. These self-dissolving micro-darts are formulated with a powerful brightening cocktail of arbutin, tranexamic acid, kojic acid, vitamin C, and niacinamide, all of which work together to help eradicate darkness left behind by pimples by delivering the formula directly into the affected area. Seeing as these micro darts are the most potent of all the pimple patches, you might get some redness if you’re on the sensitive side and should proceed with caution. However, if you know your skin can tolerate these ingredients, it’s a great way to spot treat stubborn dark marks that just won’t fade on their own.\n\n$34 FOR 12 AT AMAZON\n$34 FOR 12 AT ULTA BEAUTY\nGET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER\nActually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.\nEmail\n \n\nThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.

We want to assure our readers that we still stand by our recommendations, which we do.\n\nPeriod, pimples. I forgot to wash my face, pimples. I ate too much sugar, pimples. The list goes on and on. Pimples are a part of life. Well, for most of us that aren\'t blessed with perfect, poreless pimple-free skin. I assumed that once I hit my 30s, pimples would be a thing of the past, but hormonal whiteheads and even the occasional cystic pimple I can count on to crop up at least once a month.\xa0\n\nLucky for us, instead of slathering our blemishes with toothpaste (which is a no-no, by the way) or spot treating with clay or a liquid treatment that rubs off on our pillows overnight, we have pimple patches. There are quite a few on the market. Today I\'ll be trying one of the highest rated brands: COSRX Pimple Patch.\n\nKeep reading to see how my experience with these blemish-busting patches went.\n\nCOSRX ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH\n\nBEST FOR: Zapping and healing pimples on all skin types\n\nKEY INGREDIENTS: Hydrocolloid\n\nPRICE: $19\n\nABOUT THE BRAND: Founded in 2019, this K-beauty company was created to help individuals find products that would help their many skin conditions.\n\nAbout My Skin: Combination with hyperpigmentation and monthly hormonal breakouts\n\nMy skin can be unpredictable. But, as I\'ve gotten older, I realize that less is more for my sensitive, reactive skin. I can no longer experiment with new skincare products the same way I used to because the tiniest change can cause my skin to break out in painful, red bumps. Fragrance, physical exfoliators, and overzealous cleansers set those reactions off. My skincare routine is now hydrating and straightforward. I start with cleansing twice a day with a cream cleanser. For my daytime routine, I apply niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C. At night, I tone and use retinol. In between cleansing, I chemically exfoliate and apply a clarifying mask once a week.\xa0\xa0\n\nIngredients: One key, familiar ingredient\xa0\n\nThe tiny dermatologist-tested, paraben-free patches are made with a medical-grade material that is said to speed up healing and protect blemishes from bacteria. The Hydrocolloid Bandage is a biodegradable, breathable, opaque, and sometimes transparent dressing typically used to heal wounds.\n\nThe Feel: Like a bandage\n\nYou can expect the tiny dots to feel and seal like a bandage you use on a cut.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Packaging: Easy to store\n\nThe 24 patches come in a white ziplock bag with another sheet holding the patches. The patches come in three different sizes.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Results: An overnight reduction in the size of my blemish\n\nI placed the patch on my skin after cleansing and applying my serums.\n\nEven with my serums applied, the patch stuck to my skin and didn\'t budge overnight.\n\nIf you use oil or heavy creams, you may want to skip them on the pimple you plan to spot treat just in case. I wasn\'t expecting a quick fix the next morning, but I am happy to report that while the pimple wasn\'t gone, it was significantly smaller. I count this as a win in my book. I don\'t believe in overnight skincare treatments, but these patches changed my mind.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nThe Value: Worth it\n\nWas this patch able to treat a single pimple and yield quick results? Yes. $19 bucks might feel like a hefty investment upfront, but these patches will last you for a while. Not to mention, they will keep picking pimples and potential irritation at bay.\xa0\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nSimilar Products: You\'ve got options\xa0\n\nsquish.

And while those mishaps are certainly not ideal, almost nothing is more demoralizing than waking up to a glaring red blemish on your face.\n\nUnfortunately, zits happen to just about everyone. In fact, acne affects more than 50 million Americans, according to the American Academy of Dermatology Association (AADA). Although getting pimples is normal, they can be painful and distracting. Pimple patches won’t get rid of acne forever, but they can help with sudden one-off blemishes.\n\nNot familiar with these spot treatments? “Pimple patches are small stickers that are made with a soothing gel called hydrocolloid,” says Dr. Bradley Glodny, a board-certified dermatologist and owner of Park Avenue Dermatology in New York City. As this hydrocolloid gel adheres to the skin, it absorbs excess oil and dirt away from pimples, says Dr. Hadley King, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.\n\n"While stuck to the skin, acne patches also have the added benefit of preventing you from picking or trying to pop the pimple," says King. This is key because when you pick at a pimple, it increases inflammation, can prolong healing time and boosts the risk of infection, discoloration and scarring.\n\nSKIP AHEAD The best pimple patches of 2023 | How to shop for pimple patches | When are pimple patches most effective?\n\nTo help you determine the best pimple patch for your skin, we spoke with dermatologists about what to look for when shopping and added in highly rated options from retailers like Amazon, Target and Sephora that align with our experts’ guidance.\n\nSelected.Our top picks\nBest overall\nZitSticka Killa Kit\n$29.00\n$36.00\nAMAZON\nLearn more\nBest for oily skin\nPeace Out Acne Healing Dots\n$19.00\nAMAZON\nLearn more\nBest for sensitive skin\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch\n$17.86\nAMAZON\nLearn more\nRelated\nSELECT\n13 best skin care products for acne-prone skin, according to experts\nHow we chose the best pimple patches\n\nTo choose the best pimple patches, we asked experts what key factors to prioritize when shopping. Here is what they say to keep in mind:\n\nLook for acne-fighting ingredients: Some pimple patches are made using only hydrocolloid gel, while others are infused with additional acne-fighting ingredients. What will work best for you will depend on your skin type, according to Dr. Orit Markowitz, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of OptiSkin Medical in New York City. If you have sensitive skin, you may want a basic hydrocolloid patch;if your zits are more stubborn, consider patches with blemish-busting ingredients like salicylic acid or tea tree oil. If you are dealing with a deep, cystic pimple, Glodny suggests looking for a patch with micropoints (also called micro darts), which are tiny points that gently penetrate the skin to deliver ingredients deeper.\nSize: No two pimples are exactly alike, so different sized and shaped patches will help you target different types of breakouts. A larger sticker can tackle a cluster of pimples, while a little circle is a good choice for a small whitehead.\nThe best pimple patches of October 2023\n\nWe consulted three New York-based dermatologists about their top pimple patch recommendations, plus considered options that earned high ratings from Select staff members and reviewers who have used them.\n\nZitSticka Killa Kit\nZitSticka Killa Kit\n$29.00\n$36.00\nAMAZON\n$29.00\nULTA\n$16.00\nTARGET\n\nBoth King and Markowitz recommend Zitsticka patches, which come with priming cleaning swabs to use before applying the patch. "I like that they have micro darts filled with salicylic acid, niacinamide and oligopeptide-76 to treat pimples," says King. “It enables these ingredients, all of which help reduce acne, to really get in there.” They also contain hyaluronic acid, which balances out the potential drying effect of salicylic acid so your zit doesn’t start to flake and scab as it heals, according to Markowitz.\n\nPeace Out Acne Healing Dots\nPeace Out Acne Healing Dots\n$19.00\nAMAZON\n$19.00\nSEPHORA\n$19.00\nULTA\n\nKing is also a fan of these pimple patches, which are available in packs of 20 and 60. The patches combine hydrocolloid and salicylic acid to help remove oil and debris from clogged pores. They also contain aloe vera leaf extract, which has anti-inflammatory properties that help soothe and calm redness, according to King.\n\nPeach Slices Acne Spot Dots\nPeach Slices Acne Spot Dots\n$4.88\nAMAZON\n$4.99\nULTA\n$4.99\nCVS PHARMACY\n\nThese highly-rated acne patches are ideal for dry or sensitive skin since they skip potentially drying agents, like salicylic acid. The translucent, hydrocolloid patches come in three sizes — 7mm, 10mm and 12mm, which you can use as needed to cover a single small zit or a cluster. "The smallest is one of the smallest options I\'ve seen, and they are also thinner than most hydrocolloid patches — so this makes them easier to wear without it being obvious,” says King. To use these cleanse your skin first, apply the patch and then remove after eight hours, according to the brand.\n\nDr. Jart+ Focuspot Micro Tip Blemish Patches\nDr. Jart+ Focuspot Micro Tip Blemish Patches\n$14.99\nWALMART\n\nMarkowitz is a fan of these acne patches, which use ingredients like niacinamide and antioxidant-rich turmeric, to help soothe very inflamed pimples. Dr. Jart offers two types of pimple patches: a blemish option, which uses vitamin B3 to help clear breakouts and hyaluronic acid for hydration and a dark spot option, which relies on vitamin C to help fade discoloration, according to the brand. The latter is great for darker skin tones, who tend to be left with dark spots as acne heals, says Markowitz.\n\nMario Badescu Drying Patches\nMario Badescu Drying Patches\n$17.00\nAMAZON\n$17.00\nULTA\n$17.00\nWALMART\n\nThese patches are another favorite of King’s because of its ingredients: they have salicylic acid and hyaluronic acid to hydrate the skin, plus niacinamide, which can help improve skin tone and texture. Select’s associate updates editor, Zoe Malin, is a fan of because of how thin they are. “They are practically invisible when you put them on,” she says. “So you can totally wear them during the day when working from home — I doubt anyone would be able to tell you were wearing them on a video call.”\n\nHero Cosmetics Invisible Mighty Patch\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch\n$17.86\nAMAZON\n$17.99\nTARGET\n$17.99\nULTA\n\n“The patches are very effective at extracting a pimple, but it may take a couple rounds of patches depending on how deep or large of a pimple it is,” says Select’s editorial projects associate Rebecca Rodriguez, who tried them for Select’s Wellness Awards. “I like that they’re a little more translucent than other patches I have tried because they blend well with my skin tone and don’t scream ‘hey I’ve got a pimple.’” Unlike other patches that have additional acne-fighting ingredients, these solely rely on the hydrocolloid gel to draw out any sebum or debris from your skin, which makes them gentle for sensitive skin.\n\nCosrx Pimple Patches\nCosrx Pimple Patches\n$13.00\nAMAZON\n\nKing likes these because each package contains small, medium and large hydrocolloid bandages, giving you options for pimples of different sizes. These Cosrx patches rely solely on hydrocolloid gel to remove excess oil so they’re an ideal option for anyone with sensitive skin because there are no additional ingredients to irritate you, according to King. These are also one of the most consistently highly rated options on our list with an average 4.5-star rating from 32,129 reviews on Amazon.\n\nStarface Hydro Stars\nStarface Hydro Stars\n$14.97\nAMAZON\n$14.97\nWALMART\n$14.99\nTARGET\n\nThese fragrance-free, star-shaped patches add a little fun to your acne-fighting journey. “Getting a pimple can be such a bummer,” says contributing editor Bethany Heitman. “These bright yellow stars add an element of fun to the entire experience. Because of the shape, I found they were best for smaller zits. I mostly wear them at home. But, I did wear a few to a recent Taylor Swift concert — they covered my breakout and felt festive.” A 100% hydrocolloid option, Markowitz also says they are helpful for reducing zit-related inflammation on sensitive skin.\n\nNexcare Acne Absorbing Cover\nNexcare Acne Absorbing Cover\n$18.57\n$19.98\nAMAZON\n$19.30\nWALMART\n\nAnother 100% hydrocolloid option, these patches from Nexcare come in a pack of 36 or 108 patches and are another favorite of Markowitz’s. Like the Mighty Patch option from Hero Cosmetics, these turn white once any oily secretion is absorbed, according to the brand. Do not combine these patches with other acne medications or treatments though, according to Nexcare.\n\nAvarelle Acne Cover Patch\nAvarelle Acne Cover Patch\n$8.49\nAMAZON\n$13.61\nWALMART\n\nThese round, unscented patches, which have a 4.3-star average rating from 72,888 reviews on Amazon, contain tea tree oil to help shrink pimples. They’re also infused with calendula, which is known to soothe irritation, according to the brand. In the packet, you’ll get 40 patches in small, medium and large sizes.\n\nHow to shop for pimple patches\n\nPicking the best option is all about considering your skin’s specific needs. Simple hydrocolloid patches are ideal for sensitive skin, says Glodny. If you don’t have sensitive skin, you can consider patches that either have micro darts (little points that help ingredients get deeper into a zit by creating small pricks in the skin) or the following acne-fighting ingredients:\n\nSalicylic acid is a beta hydroxy acid that can help unclog pores or remove excess sebum. Patches containing salicylic acid could be a good option for a fairly inflamed pimple, but may irritate dryer, sensitive skin.\nTea tree oil or tea tree extract can be very drying, says Markowitz. This makes it a great tool for drying out pimples. However, if you have dry or sensitive skin, it’s probably best to skip it.\nHyaluronic acid is often paired with other, more drying ingredients like salicylic acid. That’s because it helps to hydrate the skin and can prevent drying caused by other ingredients associated with fighting acne, says King.\nNiacinamide is another great addition to a pimple patch because it can improve skin tone and texture, according to King. “Plus, it has stabilizing effects on the skin’s barrier function, which can help improve moisture retention.”\n\n\nFrequently asked questions\nCan pimple patches make acne worse?\n\nAs long as you\'re not allergic or sensitive to an ingredient found in the patches, pimple patches should not make acne worse, according to our experts. As mentioned, patches with salicylic acid or tea tree oil can be more irritating — if you have sensitive skin, skip patches with these ingredients in them.\n\nWorried peeling the patch off will hurt or cause damage? Don’t be. Pimple patches aren’t like bandages for cuts or wounds. The hydrocolloid gel makes them less sticky, so they gently sit on top of your pimple and then easily (and gently) peel off when you’re ready. In fact, they can actually prevent scarring. These patches prevent you from picking at your blemish or trying to pop it on your own, which is what can lead to scarring and hyperpigmentation, says Glodny.\n\nWhen are pimple patches most effective?\n\nPimple patches can be very effective on mild breakouts and superficial pimples like small whiteheads and pustules that are just popping up or that recently came to a head, says King. They can also work on cystic acne . “This type of acne sits deeper underneath the skin, making it more challenging for acne-fighting ingredients to get to,” says Glodny. “The prolonged contact that a pimple patch has (you usually keep them on for six to eight hours) means that the ingredients have time to really penetrate.” However, deeper pimples may require multiple nights of treatment with a pimple patch before they’re fully gone.\n\nAnother pro of over-the-counter pimple patches is that hydrocolloid patches generally don\'t dehydrate your skin or leave it flaky, compared to more harsh acne spot treatments featuring salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, according to King. She adds that pimple patches are most effective on sensitive skin and mild acne patients, although those with oily, combination, normal and even dry skin can also use them and see results.\n\nHow do you apply a pimple patch?\n\nTo avoid transferring bacteria to your pimple, wash your hands before applying a patch. Make sure your skin is clean and dry as well and skip any spot treatment creams, according to Glodny. By doubling up, you risk irritation or drying out your skin, plus, the patch won’t stay put if your skin is sticky with cream.\n\nTo adhere the patch to your pimple, peel it off the sheet and center it over your zit. Press down gently and it will stick to your skin. Then, if you need to apply other face products (like moisturizer or makeup), just avoid the area directly around the sticker, according to our experts.\n\nMeet our experts\n\nAt Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

Learn more\n\nHydrocolloid patches absorb pus from pimples, resulting in noticeably smaller and less inflamed blemishes.\nI\'ve tried a couple brands of patches, and Mighty Patch has worked better than any of them.\nYears after I first discovered the brand, I still buy them for myself all the time. They\'re a clear and effective overnight fix for acne-prone skin.\xa0\nAdvertisement\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Original (36-count)\nShop at Amazon \nShop at Ulta Beauty \nShop at Walmart \n\nFrom extraction facials and laser treatments to special face washes and oral antibiotics, I\'ve tried many tactics in my decade-old battle with acne. Some, like acne extractions, work very well over the long term, but are quite expensive. Others have dried out my skin or even resulted in more breakouts. The only solution that really works for short-term relief — and that I wish I had tried way earlier — is the hydrocolloid patch.\xa0\n\nHydrocolloid patches were originally designed for wounds but it turns out they\'re also perfect for those painful (both physically and emotionally) breakouts that always erupt the night before a big event like an interview or a date.\xa0\n\nAdvertisement\nHow hydrocolloid acne patches work\n\nThese patches attract water and absorb fluids such as pus so that by the next day, you can literally see everything they\'ve sucked up from your pimples. COSRX was one ofthe first hydrocolloid patch brands, earning rave reviews from other media sites like Buzzfeed and Refinery29 and a 4.6-star rating from 25,000+ Amazon reviews, but I\'m a stronger believer in a newer brand\'s hydrocolloid product: Hero Cosmetics\' Mighty Patch, which has a 4.5-star rating and over 90,000 Amazon reviews.\xa0\n\nHero Cosmetics/Facebook\nAdvertisement\nMighty Patch review\n\nMighty Patch\'s Original hydrocolloid patches come in 36- or 72-count packs, and each one measures 12mm across — smaller than a penny. There are also Invisible versions that are thinner and more difficult to see, as well as Surface patches for large clusters of pimples. They work best on pimples with fluid or pus in them, meaning there\'s a visible whitehead.\n\nAfter showering and drying my face, I stick the patches directly on the blemishes that fit this description, then let them work their magic. Sometimes, depending on the pimple, I can see and feel results in as quickly as a few hours. Other times, they take longer to take effect, and I sleep with them overnight.\n\nHero Cosmetics\n\nThe results are somewhat gross, but oddly satisfying: The sticker turns white with the pus it has absorbed.\n\nThe difference after applying a sticker is clear, and not only visually. Each time, my pimples dramatically reduced in both size and pain. I\'m always amazed at how well they work. Over the last couple of years, I\'ve become very comfortable with slapping them all over my face every night, and even during the daytime when I go to work.\xa0\n\nAdvertisement\nCons of Mighty Patch\n\nThe main drawback of these patches is that they can be noticeable if you wear them (the Original product) in public. As a solution, the company made Invisible patches (find our review here), which are more subtle and harder to notice.\xa0\n\nIf you\'re new to pimple patches, you may also find it difficult to peel them off the sheet without wrinkling or folding them, but Hero Cosmetics tries to combat this with an easy-peel sheet design that tears the entire sheet into thirds.\xa0\n\nAdvertisement\nUnexpected benefits of Mighty Patch\n\nA side benefit of these hydrocolloid patches is that they prevent bored, wandering fingers from touching and picking pimples. Every person who has acne hears over and over again and knows from personal experience that picking leads to irritation and scarring, but it\'s much easier said than done not to do it. As the patches work to minimize your blemish, they also protect the affected area from exposure to unclean pillows and hands.\xa0\n\nMighty Patch versus COSRX and other competitors\xa0\n\nI also bought myself the COSRX patches to compare their performance, and considering their high reviews and cult status, I was surprised to find they were much less effective than Mighty Patch. The COSRX hydrocolloid patches come in multiple sizes, and they\'re cheaper than Mighty Patch. However, they were prone to falling off my face as I slept, and rarely absorbed as much fluid as the Mighty Patch stickers.\xa0\n\nIn addition to COSRX, I\'ve tried many other patches like the cute (but ultimately ineffective) Starface Hydro-Stars and No B.S. Healing Acne Patches, but again and again, they didn\'t stack up to Mighty Patch.\n\nWhile Mighty Patch may be more expensive, I\'d much rather opt for the product that actually works. The company originally sent me free samples for review back in April 2018, but since then, I\'ve regularly bought them myself and they\'ve become an integral part of my skin-care kit.\xa0\n\nAdvertisement\nThe bottom line\n\nHaving dealt with acne since I was a teen, I regret not trying these gentle, non-invasive, and non-drying hydrocolloid patches earlier, but I\'m now a serious proponent of using them for banishing acne. They\'re easy to slip into your bag to take on the go, and as simple stickers, they\'re low maintenance.\xa0\n\nI\'m stocking up on the ones from Mighty Patch\xa0in particular because they\'ve shown time after time that they\'re the best on the market.\xa0\n\nShop at Amazon\nShop at Ulta Beauty\nShop at Walmart\nConnie Chen\nConnie Chen is a former senior reporter on the Insider Reviews team, where she led coverage of home textiles, home entertaining, and food and drink.

Now, if you notice an angry zit developing, you pop on a pimple patch for a few hours and the sticker will suck the nastiness out of your skin. Each week, it seems that another new pimple patch has entered the market, so we spoke to skin-care experts — including board-certified dermatologists and our resident beauty writer — to find out what to look for in a pimple patch and which ones are the best. But before reading on, take stock of the one piece of advice all of our experts were unanimous about: Stop picking your pimples!\n\nWhat we’re looking for\nIngredients\n\nHydrocolloid — a fluid-absorbing gel — is the ingredient in most pimple patches. “Hydrocolloids are wound dressings that have been used for decades on the skin for chronic ulcers, trauma wounds, and even burns,” says Dr. Jamie Glick, a dermatologist at New York Dermatology Group. You may have already used a hydrocolloid patch to treat a blister or small wound, and the process with pimple patches is the same: They draw out any excess oil and gunk. The patches also help acne blemishes to heal by acting as a physical barrier, keeping out bacteria and stopping you from picking. “Long before I was a dermatologist, my mother used to say, ‘Touching a pimple is like watering a plant — it will grow and grow,’” Glick says. “I use that phrase all the time with my patients and recommend acne patches especially to my patients who are pickers.”\n\nSome other common ingredients in pimple patches include active acne-treating topicals like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and tea-tree oil. But Dr. Amy Perlmutter, also of the New York Dermatology Group, recommends “sticking with the hydrocolloid-only patches unless evaluated by a dermatologist and instructed otherwise. This is because patches with active acne-fighting ingredients have the potential to irritate and/or dry out the skin.” If your skin is sensitive, that’s an even higher risk for you.\n\nAppearance\n\nThe majority of pimple patches are designed to look as imperceptible as possible, so in theory, you can pop one on and head out without it being super-obvious. Most of the patches on this list, then, are small, thin, transparent dots, making them hard to spot on any skin tone. But that’s not always the case. I’ve outlined what each patch looks like and what sizes they come in to best suit your needs.\n\nPrice\n\nBeneath each pack, I’ve made a note of the price per patch.\n\nBest patches overall\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Original Acne Patches\n$12 now 20% off\n$10 for 36\n\nIngredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dot, one size (12 mm) | Price: $0.36 per patch\n\nDr. Perlmutter recommends these patches from Hero Cosmetics. They contain medical-grade hydrocolloid to remove excess fluid and oils from blemishes, but she says they also “maintain optimum PH level and temperature, which helps prevent bacterial overgrowth and promote healing.” Mighty Patches take about six to eight hours to work, so they are a great option to use overnight. Any oil sucked out turns white on the transparent patch, so you can really see the benefit. These patches contain only hydrocolloid, so they shouldn’t dry out sensitive skin. They’re also transparent — turning slightly opaque once they’re finished — so look subtle on a variety of skin tones. Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Margarita Lolis also finds that as the patches are matte, they blend in well if you’re layering foundation over them. They’re also great value for money.\n\n$10 FOR 36 AT AMAZON\n$13 FOR 36 AT HERO COSMETICS\nBest less-expensive patches\nThe Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch\n$6\n\nIngredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dot, mix of medium (10 mm) and large (14 mm) | Price: $0.14\n\nAt $6 for 42 patches —\xa0or just $0.14 per sticker — the Klog patches are amazing value. “The patch is thinner and almost clear, which helps it camouflage better into most skin tones,” says Carmen Castilla, M.D., who also appreciates the mix of patch sizes for different-size pimples. “Hydrocolloid patches are also unlikely to cause irritation, so they work well even on those with more sensitive skin types,” she says.\n\n$6 AT SOKO GLAM\nBest patches for whiteheads\nCOSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch\n$6 for 24\n\nIngredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dot, mix of small (7 mm), medium (10 mm) and large (12 mm) | Price: $0.25 per patch\n\n“Cosrx Pimple Patches are the holy grail. Drop everything and buy them,” says Strategist beauty writer Rio Viera-Newton. She recommended these patches in her original skin-care Google doc and thinks that they work best for extracting every last bit of gunk from whiteheads. “If you pop or pick a zit, put this on immediately afterward, go to bed, and in the morning, you’ll see what I’m talking about and thank me.” And while we’re not recommending picking, hey — we know it happens.\n\n$6 FOR 24 AT DERMSTORE\nBest patches for body acne\nNeutrogena Stubborn Acne Ultra-Thin Blemish Patches\n$8\n\nIngredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dots or triangles, exact size not listed | Price: $0.33 per patch\n\nDr. Perlmutter also likes these ultrathin options from Neutrogena, which are more discreet when applied. They’re available in either dot or triangle shapes, with the latter specifically designed for angling on the side of your nose or for treating larger breakouts on the back or the chest. Containing just hydrocolloid, they’re nondrying and nonirritating.\n\n$8 AT AMAZON\n$8 AT TARGET\nBest almost invisible patches\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Invisible+\n$18 now 22% off\n$14\n\nIngredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Ultra-thin transparent dots, mix of small (10 mm) and medium (12 mm) | Price: $0.46 per patch\n\nThese patches, another by Mighty Patch, are a favorite of both Dr. Shereene Idriss, a board-certified dermatologist, and Viera-Newton. They’re great because they’re “super-ultrathin, so you can barely see them — sometimes I even lose track of where I’ve put them when I look in the mirror,” says Viera-Newton. “On days where I have a really bad zit and want it to be protected from the horrible grime of the city, I use these. I’ve even thrown some concealer on top of it to further disguise it.” Again, they contain only hydrocolloid, so they are kind to sensitive skin.\n\n$14 AT AMAZON\n$18 AT HERO COSMETICS\nBest colorful patches\nStarface Hydro-Stars Starter Pack (32-Count)\n$15\n\nIngredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Neon yellow stars, 12 mm | Price: $0.46 per patch\n\nDr Idriss, Viera-Newton, and Dr. Perlmutter each recommend these fun pimple patches (that you’re sure to have seen on your feed at least once.) Each one is shaped like a star and uses hydrocolloid to draw out oil and gunk from pimples. They inject a bit of whimsy into not picking away at your face all day — at an affordable price point.\n\n$15 AT AMAZON\n$15 AT STARFACE\nBest colorful patches with darts\nStarface Micro-cloud\n$18\n\nIngredients: Hydrocolloid, niacinamide, and salicylic acid | Appearance: Baby-blue clouds, 12 mm. | Price: $1.50 per patch\n\n“The blue cloud patch is fun if you are not trying to camouflage the fact you have a pimple patch on,” says Dr. Castilla. But these cloud-shaped patches differ from the original Starface patches beyond just the look, says dermatologist Dr. Kristina Collins. In addition to hydrocolloid, they have darts that contain niacinamide and salicylic acid. The hydrocolloid dressing protects the affected area from dirt and will also help absorb pus and oil away from the skin, while the salicylic acid helps increase cell turnover and dissolve any dead skin cells clogging the pores. Niacinamide then helps to reduce inflammation.\n\nThe patches are ideal for targeting cystic pimples in the early stages. If you feel the signature aching of a gnarly under-the-skin pimple, that’s the ideal time to press one on. However, as the additional ingredients may cause irritation, neither doctor recommends these patches to those with sensitive skin, instead pointing patients back toward the original Starface patches.\n\n$18 AT STARFACE\nBest patches for larger spots\nAcropass Trouble Cure\n$18\n\nIngredients: Tea tree, salicylic acid, hyaluronic acid | Appearance: Transparent dots, one size (not listed) | Price: $3 per treatment (a wipe and a patch)\n\nThe Acropass Trouble Cure is actually a two-step process involving a wipe that treats your skin before you apply the patch. The wipe pairs acne-fighting tea-tree oil and salicylic acid, which can dry the skin, but the patch adds moisture back. “The Acropass has teeny-tiny microneedles infused with hyaluronic acid, an ingredient that deeply hydrates the skin, and niacinamide, a form of vitamin B3, which has brightening and soothing effects,” explains Viera-Newton. “The microneedles — which, I know, sound scary — are so thin you can barely feel them, and they puncture the zit to attack it from the inside out.” After testing them on a few different types of blemish, Viera-Newton says these work best on large, intimidating, unpoppable spots.\n\n$18 AT SOKO GLAM\nBest patches for hormonal acne\nZitSticka Killa Kit 8-Pack\n$29\n\nIngredients: Salicylic acid, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid | Appearance: Transparent dots (one size, not listed) | Price: $3.62 per patch\n\n“Into adulthood, I’ve still been plagued with monthly flare-ups of hormonal cysts on my chin. Like clockwork, the deep, painful, under-the-skin growths erupt to trumpet the arrival of my period,” says Strategist writer Dominique Pariso. After testing a few pimple patches and getting nowhere, she decided to try the multistep patches from ZitSticka. They work in a similar way to the Acropass patches — micro-darts push salicylic acid, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid into the skin. But the ZitSticka patches also have a hydrocolloid top layer, meaning they can fight acne before it develops. “The first time I slapped the patches on before bed, I woke up to find that the monster welts lurking beneath my face were flatter, calmer, and less red than they had been the night before,” says Pariso, whose cysts now clear up in a couple of days as opposed to a couple of weeks.\n\n$29 AT AMAZON\nBest easy-to-apply patches\nBioré Cover & Conquer Blemish Patches\n$12\n\nIngredients: Hydrocolloid | Appearance: Transparent dots, 15 mm. | Price: $0.40 per patch\n\n“Bioré patches feature perforated packaging, which makes it easier to get the pimple patch off without bending the corners,” says Dr. Castilla. That’s important because “if the corners are bent, the pimple patch is more visible and doesn’t stick as well. It also allows you to put the patch on without touching the part that will lay on your skin, meaning the patch itself stays clean.” As the Bioré patches are just hydrocolloid, without any active ingredients, they’re suitable for even sensitive skin, but the patches do only come in one size, so they’re not the best option if you want a wide variety.\n\n$12 AT AMAZON\nSome other products to combat breakouts\nOur favorite drugstore cleanser\n$8\n$8 AT WALMART\n$8 AT NEUTROGENA\nAn oil-free water-based moisturizer\n$15\n$27 now 44% off\n$15 AT AMAZON\n$20 AT TARGET\nAn oil to treat existing acne scars (and prevent new ones)\n$74\nBUY AT SEPHORA\nOur experts\n\n• Dr. Carmen Castilla, board-certified dermatologist at New York Dermatology Group and clinical instructor at Mount Sinai Hospital\n• Dr. Kristina Collins, board-certified dermatologist\n• Dr. Jamie Glick, dermatologist at NY Dermatology Group\n• Dr. Shereene Idriss, board Certified Dermatologist\n• Dr. Margarita Lolis, board-certified dermatologist\n• Dominique Pariso, Strategist writer\n• Dr. Amy Perlmutter, dermatologist at NY Dermatology Group\n• Rio Viera-Newton, Strategist beauty writer\n\nGET THE STRATEGIST NEWSLETTER\nActually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.\nEmail\n \n\nThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.

And while those mishaps are certainly not ideal, almost nothing is more demoralizing than waking up to a glaring red blemish on your face.\n\nUnfortunately, zits happen to just about everyone. In fact, acne affects more than 50 million Americans, according to the American Academy of Dermatology Association (AADA). Although getting pimples is normal, they can be painful and distracting. Pimple patches won’t get rid of acne forever, but they can help with sudden one-off blemishes.\n\nNot familiar with these spot treatments? “Pimple patches are small stickers that are made with a soothing gel called hydrocolloid,” says Dr. Bradley Glodny, a board-certified dermatologist and owner of Park Avenue Dermatology in New York City. As this hydrocolloid gel adheres to the skin, it absorbs excess oil and dirt away from pimples, says Dr. Hadley King, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.\n\n"While stuck to the skin, acne patches also have the added benefit of preventing you from picking or trying to pop the pimple," says King. This is key because when you pick at a pimple, it increases inflammation, can prolong healing time and boosts the risk of infection, discoloration and scarring.\n\nSKIP AHEAD The best pimple patches of 2023 | How to shop for pimple patches | When are pimple patches most effective?\n\nTo help you determine the best pimple patch for your skin, we spoke with dermatologists about what to look for when shopping and added in highly rated options from retailers like Amazon, Target and Sephora that align with our experts’ guidance.\n\nSelected.Our top picks\nBest overall\nZitSticka Killa Kit\n$29.00\n$36.00\nAMAZON\nLearn more\nBest for oily skin\nPeace Out Acne Healing Dots\n$19.00\nAMAZON\nLearn more\nBest for sensitive skin\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch\n$17.86\nAMAZON\nLearn more\nRelated\nSELECT\n13 best skin care products for acne-prone skin, according to experts\nHow we chose the best pimple patches\n\nTo choose the best pimple patches, we asked experts what key factors to prioritize when shopping. Here is what they say to keep in mind:\n\nLook for acne-fighting ingredients: Some pimple patches are made using only hydrocolloid gel, while others are infused with additional acne-fighting ingredients. What will work best for you will depend on your skin type, according to Dr. Orit Markowitz, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of OptiSkin Medical in New York City. If you have sensitive skin, you may want a basic hydrocolloid patch;if your zits are more stubborn, consider patches with blemish-busting ingredients like salicylic acid or tea tree oil. If you are dealing with a deep, cystic pimple, Glodny suggests looking for a patch with micropoints (also called micro darts), which are tiny points that gently penetrate the skin to deliver ingredients deeper.\nSize: No two pimples are exactly alike, so different sized and shaped patches will help you target different types of breakouts. A larger sticker can tackle a cluster of pimples, while a little circle is a good choice for a small whitehead.\nThe best pimple patches of October 2023\n\nWe consulted three New York-based dermatologists about their top pimple patch recommendations, plus considered options that earned high ratings from Select staff members and reviewers who have used them.\n\nZitSticka Killa Kit\nZitSticka Killa Kit\n$29.00\n$36.00\nAMAZON\n$29.00\nULTA\n$16.00\nTARGET\n\nBoth King and Markowitz recommend Zitsticka patches, which come with priming cleaning swabs to use before applying the patch. "I like that they have micro darts filled with salicylic acid, niacinamide and oligopeptide-76 to treat pimples," says King. “It enables these ingredients, all of which help reduce acne, to really get in there.” They also contain hyaluronic acid, which balances out the potential drying effect of salicylic acid so your zit doesn’t start to flake and scab as it heals, according to Markowitz.\n\nPeace Out Acne Healing Dots\nPeace Out Acne Healing Dots\n$19.00\nAMAZON\n$19.00\nSEPHORA\n$19.00\nULTA\n\nKing is also a fan of these pimple patches, which are available in packs of 20 and 60. The patches combine hydrocolloid and salicylic acid to help remove oil and debris from clogged pores. They also contain aloe vera leaf extract, which has anti-inflammatory properties that help soothe and calm redness, according to King.\n\nPeach Slices Acne Spot Dots\nPeach Slices Acne Spot Dots\n$4.88\nAMAZON\n$4.99\nULTA\n$4.99\nCVS PHARMACY\n\nThese highly-rated acne patches are ideal for dry or sensitive skin since they skip potentially drying agents, like salicylic acid. The translucent, hydrocolloid patches come in three sizes — 7mm, 10mm and 12mm, which you can use as needed to cover a single small zit or a cluster. "The smallest is one of the smallest options I\'ve seen, and they are also thinner than most hydrocolloid patches — so this makes them easier to wear without it being obvious,” says King. To use these cleanse your skin first, apply the patch and then remove after eight hours, according to the brand.\n\nDr. Jart+ Focuspot Micro Tip Blemish Patches\nDr. Jart+ Focuspot Micro Tip Blemish Patches\n$14.99\nWALMART\n\nMarkowitz is a fan of these acne patches, which use ingredients like niacinamide and antioxidant-rich turmeric, to help soothe very inflamed pimples. Dr. Jart offers two types of pimple patches: a blemish option, which uses vitamin B3 to help clear breakouts and hyaluronic acid for hydration and a dark spot option, which relies on vitamin C to help fade discoloration, according to the brand. The latter is great for darker skin tones, who tend to be left with dark spots as acne heals, says Markowitz.\n\nMario Badescu Drying Patches\nMario Badescu Drying Patches\n$17.00\nAMAZON\n$17.00\nULTA\n$17.00\nWALMART\n\nThese patches are another favorite of King’s because of its ingredients: they have salicylic acid and hyaluronic acid to hydrate the skin, plus niacinamide, which can help improve skin tone and texture. Select’s associate updates editor, Zoe Malin, is a fan of because of how thin they are. “They are practically invisible when you put them on,” she says. “So you can totally wear them during the day when working from home — I doubt anyone would be able to tell you were wearing them on a video call.”\n\nHero Cosmetics Invisible Mighty Patch\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch\n$17.86\nAMAZON\n$17.99\nTARGET\n$17.99\nULTA\n\n“The patches are very effective at extracting a pimple, but it may take a couple rounds of patches depending on how deep or large of a pimple it is,” says Select’s editorial projects associate Rebecca Rodriguez, who tried them for Select’s Wellness Awards. “I like that they’re a little more translucent than other patches I have tried because they blend well with my skin tone and don’t scream ‘hey I’ve got a pimple.’” Unlike other patches that have additional acne-fighting ingredients, these solely rely on the hydrocolloid gel to draw out any sebum or debris from your skin, which makes them gentle for sensitive skin.\n\nCosrx Pimple Patches\nCosrx Pimple Patches\n$13.00\nAMAZON\n\nKing likes these because each package contains small, medium and large hydrocolloid bandages, giving you options for pimples of different sizes. These Cosrx patches rely solely on hydrocolloid gel to remove excess oil so they’re an ideal option for anyone with sensitive skin because there are no additional ingredients to irritate you, according to King. These are also one of the most consistently highly rated options on our list with an average 4.5-star rating from 32,129 reviews on Amazon.\n\nStarface Hydro Stars\nStarface Hydro Stars\n$14.97\nAMAZON\n$14.97\nWALMART\n$14.99\nTARGET\n\nThese fragrance-free, star-shaped patches add a little fun to your acne-fighting journey. “Getting a pimple can be such a bummer,” says contributing editor Bethany Heitman. “These bright yellow stars add an element of fun to the entire experience. Because of the shape, I found they were best for smaller zits. I mostly wear them at home. But, I did wear a few to a recent Taylor Swift concert — they covered my breakout and felt festive.” A 100% hydrocolloid option, Markowitz also says they are helpful for reducing zit-related inflammation on sensitive skin.\n\nNexcare Acne Absorbing Cover\nNexcare Acne Absorbing Cover\n$18.57\n$19.98\nAMAZON\n$19.30\nWALMART\n\nAnother 100% hydrocolloid option, these patches from Nexcare come in a pack of 36 or 108 patches and are another favorite of Markowitz’s. Like the Mighty Patch option from Hero Cosmetics, these turn white once any oily secretion is absorbed, according to the brand. Do not combine these patches with other acne medications or treatments though, according to Nexcare.\n\nAvarelle Acne Cover Patch\nAvarelle Acne Cover Patch\n$8.49\nAMAZON\n$13.61\nWALMART\n\nThese round, unscented patches, which have a 4.3-star average rating from 72,888 reviews on Amazon, contain tea tree oil to help shrink pimples. They’re also infused with calendula, which is known to soothe irritation, according to the brand. In the packet, you’ll get 40 patches in small, medium and large sizes.\n\nHow to shop for pimple patches\n\nPicking the best option is all about considering your skin’s specific needs. Simple hydrocolloid patches are ideal for sensitive skin, says Glodny. If you don’t have sensitive skin, you can consider patches that either have micro darts (little points that help ingredients get deeper into a zit by creating small pricks in the skin) or the following acne-fighting ingredients:\n\nSalicylic acid is a beta hydroxy acid that can help unclog pores or remove excess sebum. Patches containing salicylic acid could be a good option for a fairly inflamed pimple, but may irritate dryer, sensitive skin.\nTea tree oil or tea tree extract can be very drying, says Markowitz. This makes it a great tool for drying out pimples. However, if you have dry or sensitive skin, it’s probably best to skip it.\nHyaluronic acid is often paired with other, more drying ingredients like salicylic acid. That’s because it helps to hydrate the skin and can prevent drying caused by other ingredients associated with fighting acne, says King.\nNiacinamide is another great addition to a pimple patch because it can improve skin tone and texture, according to King. “Plus, it has stabilizing effects on the skin’s barrier function, which can help improve moisture retention.”\n\n\nFrequently asked questions\nCan pimple patches make acne worse?\n\nAs long as you\'re not allergic or sensitive to an ingredient found in the patches, pimple patches should not make acne worse, according to our experts. As mentioned, patches with salicylic acid or tea tree oil can be more irritating — if you have sensitive skin, skip patches with these ingredients in them.\n\nWorried peeling the patch off will hurt or cause damage? Don’t be. Pimple patches aren’t like bandages for cuts or wounds. The hydrocolloid gel makes them less sticky, so they gently sit on top of your pimple and then easily (and gently) peel off when you’re ready. In fact, they can actually prevent scarring. These patches prevent you from picking at your blemish or trying to pop it on your own, which is what can lead to scarring and hyperpigmentation, says Glodny.\n\nWhen are pimple patches most effective?\n\nPimple patches can be very effective on mild breakouts and superficial pimples like small whiteheads and pustules that are just popping up or that recently came to a head, says King. They can also work on cystic acne . “This type of acne sits deeper underneath the skin, making it more challenging for acne-fighting ingredients to get to,” says Glodny. “The prolonged contact that a pimple patch has (you usually keep them on for six to eight hours) means that the ingredients have time to really penetrate.” However, deeper pimples may require multiple nights of treatment with a pimple patch before they’re fully gone.\n\nAnother pro of over-the-counter pimple patches is that hydrocolloid patches generally don\'t dehydrate your skin or leave it flaky, compared to more harsh acne spot treatments featuring salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, according to King. She adds that pimple patches are most effective on sensitive skin and mild acne patients, although those with oily, combination, normal and even dry skin can also use them and see results.\n\nHow do you apply a pimple patch?\n\nTo avoid transferring bacteria to your pimple, wash your hands before applying a patch. Make sure your skin is clean and dry as well and skip any spot treatment creams, according to Glodny. By doubling up, you risk irritation or drying out your skin, plus, the patch won’t stay put if your skin is sticky with cream.\n\nTo adhere the patch to your pimple, peel it off the sheet and center it over your zit. Press down gently and it will stick to your skin. Then, if you need to apply other face products (like moisturizer or makeup), just avoid the area directly around the sticker, according to our experts.\n\nMeet our experts\n\nAt Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn more.\n\nBYRDIE / JACLYN MASTROPASQUA\n\nThere\'s no shortage of over-the-counter products for clearing breakouts. But when you only have one or two zits at any given time, there\'s no need to treat your entire face. Enter the pimple patch, a targeted way to zap acne without exposing the rest of your skin to undue drying or irritation. According to board-certified dermatologist Sheilagh Maguiness, MD, acne patches typically contain hydrocolloid gel,1 which is often used in wound care. Hydrocolloid patches are able to keep the spot moist in order to accelerate healing and protect. In addition to healing blemishes, Dr. Maguiness notes, "The hydrocolloid in the acne sticker can help absorb sebum and dirt."\xa0\n\nClaire Wolinsky, MD, a New York dermatologist specializing in facial rejuvenation, says she loves pimple patches and recommends them frequently: "One reason they are particularly helpful in treating acne is because once covered, patients can\'t pick or squeeze their pimple, which reduces the risk of infection and bacteria." And with less trauma to the skin, Dr. Wolinsky says you\'re less likely to experience scarring or discoloration.\n\nWe conducted hours of research on the best acne patches, evaluating each on active ingredients to target acne as well as ingredients to soothe skin and prevent redness. We also looked at things like how easy they are to apply and how well they stay on. After considering dozens of brands and consulting with two celebrity dermatologists, we landed on the following best in show.\n\n\nOur Top Picks\nBEST OVERALL:\nPeace Out Acne Dots at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST BUDGET:\nSoko Glam The Klog at Sokoglam.com\nJump to Review\nBEST DRUGSTORE:\nClearasil Ultra Overnight Spot Patches at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST SPLURGE:\nPeter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST K-BEAUTY:\nCOSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST FOR DEEP PIMPLES:\nZitSticka Killa Kit at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST FOR SCARRING:\nHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch The Original at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST MULTI-INGREDIENT:\nAvarelle Acne Cover Patch at Amazon\nJump to Review\nBEST WITH SALICYLIC ACID:\nDime Beauty Co.

"They employ hydrocolloid2 technology that helps extract impurities and guards against external elements," he explains. What\'s more, the patches create a barrier between pimples and your bacteria-laden fingers while delivering a time-released infusion of ingredients.\n\nCosmetic nurse Kristina Kitsos is also a fan of Peace Out. "They contain salicylic acid,3 which penetrates pores to target acne blemishes and blackheads," she tells Byrdie. Additionally, Kitsos appreciates that these acne patches contain soothing aloe vera to minimize redness and skin-clearing standby vitamin A (aka retinol).4 She says that since they\'re formulated with hydrating ingredients, the skin is able to heal quicker and better than if a drying, alcohol formula was used.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nIf you have skin that dries out or breaks easily, this is a great pick because of the inclusion of aloe vera—which can soothe and hydrate. Even pimple patches can sometimes tear the sensitive skin around a blemish, but you won\'t have to worry about that with these.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $19\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid, salicylic acid, aloe, retinol | Amount: 10 to 40 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\nBest BudgetSoko Glam The Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch\n\nSoko Glam\n\nVIEW ON SOKOGLAM.COM\nWhat We Like\n\nBudget-friendly\n\nLong-lasting adhesive\n\nIncludes two sizes\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nThinner patch than other options\n\nWhile most pimple patches aren\'t very pricey, The Klog\'s Soft Shield is one of the budget-friendliest of the bunch. Containing vegan hydrocolloid,2 the protective yet breathable barrier draws out impurities and helps your zits heal as quickly as possible.\xa0We love that these super-thin patches are almost invisible—perfect for wear during the day. They\'re unnoticeable whether you\'re in a virtual meeting or on a walk, and they\'ll keep your skin shielded from bacteria (and your fingers).\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nThese pimple patches can be super helpful for those who find it hard to stop themselves from picking since they are so lightweight they can be worn anytime.

Stick on the Spot Patches before bed, get your beauty sleep, and wake up to noticeable improvements in the size and redness of your blemishes.

In addition to acne-clearing mainstays salicylic acid5 and tea tree oil,6 they call on hyaluronic acid7 to deliver much-needed moisture to the bumps that lie beneath. These aren\'t hydrocolloid patches, so they won\'t absorb the gunk out of a pimple that\'s already come to a head.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nWe recommend these patches for big, red pimples that you want to reduce in size quickly.

We also like that these Korean patches come in three different sizes.\n\nWhen we tested them for ourselves, we loved that they didn\'t budge while we slept (even when applied over our nighttime serums). The pimple was noticeably smaller in the morning, and the patches kept the blemish from becoming irritated during use.\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nThese patches come in three different sizes to best fit whatever type of pimple you have. This is a great choice if you deal with frequent acne of all kinds and need a patch that can fit both smaller and larger blemishes.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $6\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 32 to 96 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\nBYRDIE / BIANCA LAMBERT\n\nBest for Deep PimplesZitSticka Killa Kit\n\nAmazon\n\nVIEW ON AMAZON\nVIEW ON ULTA\nVIEW ON VERISHOP.COM\nWhat We Like\n\nPenetrates deeper blemishes\n\nComes with cleansing swabs\n\nContains skin-clearing ingredients\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nSmall amount of patches\n\nThere\'s not much you can do about a deep pimple brewing underneath your skin—outside of placing a ZitSticka on it.

These patches are the ones that you\'ll want to try to get those hard-to-reach blemishes. It has a two-step process: swipe the pad (which is infused with tea tree oil and salicylic acid) on clean skin and then apply the patch directly to the blemish. It\'s made with super-fine microneedles so that the ingredients are able to penetrate the skin better, and the patch is also formulated with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and peptides to hydrate and heal the affected area and effectively flatten the pimple.\n\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nIf you\'ve tried everything for hormonal acne and are looking for a targeted, effective treatment without taking a trip to the dermatologist, these are a great pick. Because of the powerful formula, you should be able to see results overnight.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $18\n\nActive Ingredients: Salicylic acid, tea tree extract, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide | Amount: 6 swabs, 6 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\nBest TransparentRael Miracle Patch Invisible Spot Cover\n\nAmazon\n\nVIEW ON AMAZON\nWhat We Like\n\nVirtually invisible on the skin\n\nGreat value\n\nStays put all day\n\nWhat We Don\'t Like\n\nCould come with more sizes\n\nPimple patches are usually clear, but you can still often see the thick material—especially on darker skin tones or under makeup. If you have a blemish that you feel the need to conceal during the day, we recommend reaching for these patches from Rael. They have super thin edges that stick onto the skin seamlessly and lay as flat as possible for a hydrocolloid patch. Even though they\'re less noticeable than others on the market, they\'re still just as effective at protecting from bacteria and removing impurities from the spot overnight.\n\n\nWho It\'s For\n\nPicking at your skin is a hard habit to break, but it\'s necessary in order to not make blemishes worse and create a scar. Wearing a pimple patch throughout the day can help, and these patches from Rael will go unnoticed while you\'re out with friends or even at work.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $17\n\nActive Ingredients: Hydrocolloid | Amount: 96 patches | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\nWhere We Stand\n\nThe best pimple patches overall are Peace Out Acne Healing Dots. They contain hydrocolloid, and also a blend of soothing and clearing ingredients like retinol, salicylic acid, and aloe. For a more affordable option, consider The Klog Soft Shield Pimple Patch, a breathable yet protective solution that draws out impurities and speeds up healing.\n\nWhat to Look for When Buying Acne Patches\nHydrocolloid: "The most important thing is that the stickers or patches are made of hydrocolloid," Dr. Wolinsky tells Byrdie, which is "something dermatologists have used for wound care for a long time." The healing ingredient seals the skin underneath the patch while absorbing fluid, flattening bumps, and minimizing inflammation.8Some options, like Peach Slices Acne Spot Dots, are made with nothing more than hydrocolloid, which does an excellent job taking care of pimples on its own.\nActive Ingredients: Most acne patches utilize hydrocolloid, which can be very effective on its own. However, you\'ll also find options containing a range of other acne-fighting ingredients. As Dr. Wolinsky notes, "Some of these patches have salicylic acid, which may help further treat a nasty breakout." Additionally, you might see soothing aloe vera extract,14 resurfacing retinol,4 complexion-clearing tea tree oil,15 or hydrating hyaluronic acid12 on the ingredients list.\nDime Beauty Power Patches are an excellent choice if you\'re looking for something containing salicylic acid, and Peter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots are a great option with tea tree oil. Some patches, like Mario Badescu Drying Patches, contain both.\nSize: Since pimples and breakouts come in all shapes and sizes, it\'s nice to have a couple of different acne patches to work with. While many brands offer only one size, some packs include two or even three sizes to cover large and small zits accordingly. For instance, The Klog\'s Soft Shield Pimple Patches come with two sizes. You\'ll also find extra-large patches, which are meant to cover multi-bump breakouts.\nFAQ\nHow do acne patches work?\n\n"Most acne patches work by providing a moist occluded environment so that the acne lesion can heal underneath," says Dr. Maguiness. They typically contain hydrocolloid,8 which, as Dr. Wolinsky explains, absorbs the inflammatory fluid, flattens the bump, and speeds up healing. "The added bonus is that they keep fingers off and prevent picking," notes Dr. Maguiness.\n\n\nHow do you apply acne patches?\n\nStarting with freshly washed hands and clean, dry skin, carefully peel the patch off the sheet. Then, gently stick it on the pimple in question, aligning the center of the patch with the center of the pimple. Leave it on for 12 to 24 hours or until it turns opaque.\n\n\nHow often should you use acne patches?\n\nGenerally speaking, you can use acne patches as often as needed. Since they target only a very small portion of your skin, you shouldn\'t have to worry about irritating the rest of your face or neck. In some cases, you might need to use two or three consecutive patches to get rid of a particularly stubborn pimple.\n\n\nWhy Trust Byrdie\n\nTheresa Holland is a skincare devotee and commerce writer specializing in beauty, lifestyle, and wellness.

summary: gel acne patch opinions

Based on the provided text, the opinions about gel acne patches are generally positive. The author of the article, Connie Chen, swears by the effectiveness of hydrocolloid patches, specifically mentioning the Mighty Patch brand. She states that these patches have worked better for her than other brands she has tried. The hydrocolloid patches are described as a clear and effective overnight fix for acne-prone skin. They work by attracting water and absorbing fluids such as pus from pimples, resulting in visibly smaller and less inflamed blemishes. The author also mentions that the Mighty Patch has a 4.5-star rating and over 90,000 reviews on Amazon. 

In terms of drawbacks, the main issue with the Mighty Patch is that it can be noticeable if worn in public. However, the company offers Invisible patches that are more subtle and harder to notice. Another potential difficulty is peeling the patches off the sheet without wrinkling or folding them, although Hero Cosmetics has designed an easy-peel sheet to address this issue. 

Overall, the author highly recommends using hydrocolloid patches, particularly the Mighty Patch brand, as they have been effective in reducing the size and pain of pimples.
